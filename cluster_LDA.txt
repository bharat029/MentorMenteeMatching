Front End Development - I like the tangibility of front end. You get the satisfaction of feeling like you built something. User Experience - I like the idea of solving the user's problems & giving them value. I see that as the ultimate goal of software. Design - good design is required for good user experience.

Growing up, technology has always been in my best interests; especially how it continually transforms throughout time. Even as I'm fighting my inner demons, technology has been one of the things which keep me going up till this day. In random order, here's what interests me most in technology: 1. ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN TECHNOLOGY: As someone who loves creating and as someone who wants to build a startup, I believe that entrepreneurship is key to not only grow in tech, but in all aspects of life. Without entrepreneurship, there wouldn't be any Facebook, Yelp, Uber, etc. And within all of these established companies, new applications in technology are implemented and continued to be transformed. 2. HARDWARE: One of the reasons why I'm studying Computer Engineering is for hardware. I personally find it very exciting whenever you can implement software in hardware. As a result, you can see what you've built based on the hardware given. Examples of these include micro controllers (i.e. arduino), where you can build what you want to build and see it in real life in various applications. 3. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/DATA SCIENCE: I was going to put AR/VR as my third, though I cannot pass up how much interest I have on this topic. This field is going to be the future; what will shape our lives in the years to come. Add to that my love for creativity and hardware, the possibilities are endless when these devices and more are powered by AI. This is something I'm continuously learning upon, and hopefully implement something on my own soon.

1. Design - After reviewing several of my peers' programs and falling prey to the pitfalls of poor design, I have started placing an increasing amount of emphasis on software design and architecture. But, that is not the real reason obviously. It's much more selfish than that. I, like I mention above, live with obsessive compulsive disorder. The disorder brings with it a plethora of problems that I struggle with on a daily basis. But, it does have its positives too. One of the biggest in my opinion is my obsession with writing code as best as possible. This includes thinking about the problem thoroughly before even writing a single line of code, drawing out the algorithms I'll use and how it will work with the intended data structures, and finally writing the code itself in a well thought-out and conceived manner. This is, indeed, slow. However, I absolutely love doing it this way and am usually proud of the end result. Similarly, my obsession with writing good code makes me ask myself if there's a better or faster way to implement a particular program and I will sometimes exhaust myself trying to find the best possible implementation. Again, I'll concede that this is slow. But, I learn so much in the process and come up with excellent implementations as an end result. As technology gets more and more prevalent in society and we find ourselves surrounded by multiple devices connected to the Internet with our personal information on it, it becomes imperative that we pay attention to writing the best code we possibly can. This leads me to my next interest... 2. Security - Over seven BILLION data records have been breached since 2013 and only 8% of them account for 'secure breaches' where the stolen data was encrypted and therefore rendered useless. Millions of customer data records get stolen via hacks on large corporations such as Home Depot, Target, and JP Morgan Chase among others. While most fires can be put out simply by changing your password on relevant websites, sometimes the identity theft is severe enough to cause extensive harm. The recent Anthem hack comes to mind. Accessing private medical credentials such as names, SSNs, and health insurance numbers can be used by criminals to defraud government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Moreover, I'm severely concerned by the existence of software such as FinFisher, which can be bought on the market and be used to covertly spy on any target that the user desires to extract personal and financial information from. In the climate we live in today where massive troves of data are generated each second, I feel it's very important that we uphold that data to high standards of security. I am quite fascinated by this battle of securing our data and wish to contribute toward that end. 3. Machine learning and data mining - It is so interesting to me that there exist patterns we can find that a human mind may miss but a computer can pick up. The design, study, and implementation of models which mine data, especially via unsupervised learning, is another area which I find quite intriguing. Due to the scope for improvement in this domain and the number of challenges to overcome, I feel excited at the prospect of delving further into ML in the future.

Technology may address some of the widespread failures in care coordination, which can have devastating consequences for patients. My top 3 interests are around automating healthcare processes with tech, giving patients more access to their health records, and given patients more access to their care providers. These 3 interests all share the common goal of giving people with chronic conditions more control over their care and as a result their life.

User experience is key. Whether it’s for a concept like the Blue Line Pill or a revolutionary piece of software that assists the visually impaired in classrooms, users will not return if there is not a smooth and enjoyable interaction. I am particularly keen on incorporating more technology within classroom instruction, for example. Yet, I fear that so many products, even a Smart Board, easily frustrate users and motivate them to turn to more outdated but stable items to help teach students. This makes user experience a crucial target in technology. Design is equally important. There’s a reason Steve Jobs cautioned us to make the back of the picket fence as pretty as the front. Aesthetically, an item’s design is its window to its “soul.� It’s the first thing we use to make snap judgments and is ultimately responsible for encouraging or dissuading us to reach out and interact with an object. Design is a universal language. You do not need to speak a specific dialect to appreciate the beauty or ergonomics of a product. For those reasons, emphasis on design is crucial to engineering well received and innovative ideas. Finally, I am interested in the DIY elements of technology as it relates to the easier manufacturing of items. Take the rise of “Fab Labs� or the exponential growth of 3D Printing. These have all made it possible to learn lean production processes or even cut out traditional middle men distributors. From manufacture to the point of sale, these DIY capabilities have now truly made it possible conduct all business processes from one location. Importantly, I view this as an important movement to reduce costs associated barriers to entry in tech.

I'm passionate about entertainment, specifically film and music, and investing. Tech is disrupting entertainment and creating different channels for distribution and consumption. Music and film have been a big part of my life . I would love to invest in disruptive, entertainment focused tech companies.

My top 3 fields of interest within technology (or other disciplines in STEM) are engineering, software development, and business. At Antelope Valley College, I have taken courses Introduction to C, Introduction to C++, Assembly Language and Computer Architecture, and Data Structures. In each of these courses, I had to test, plan, and create my own programs. Outside of school, I help manage my family's two businesses. I learned how to own/manage a business since I was 10 years old. My roles included sales, customer service, stock associate, and janitor.

user experience design artificial intelligence research

I was attracted to technology because it can inform and improve our human experience. Because of that, my interests are focused in three areas: Machine learning/ AI; So we can learn new truths. Digital humanities/ Data analysis; So we can contextualize these truths. Design; So we can convey these truths.

Fintech, Business Automation & Blockchain. There are 3 premier needs of human: food, cloth & living. YONK is helping to give those 3 permier needs for human especially in third world countries.

I just want to do as much hardware repair as possible because the program that I am about to complete at Valencia only offers to teach IT skills from a business perspective and I need to learn from the consumers perspective as well.

1) Data Science: I went into college as a math major because of my interest in data analysis, but as my course work advanced the level of abstraction was hitting the stratosphere. One of my favorite assignments was the last project for data structures. We had to apply everything we've learned throughout the semester and optimize our first homework assignment and justify our design choices. I loved running tests and analyzing the data from them to create my report. 2) Software Engineering: When I started college, I had never used a computer for anything more than Netflix and MS Office. I was really intimidated by the required computer science classes for my major, but I ended up doing very well in them, and by the time I was in what I thought would be my last computer science class, I was emailing the department for special permission to take a few extra computer science classes because I loved coding so much. I want my work to include a good amount of coding. 3) Education: I've always loved teaching, and I've been a tutor and teaching assistant for my whole college career. I think I don't fully understand something until I'm able to teach someone else about it. I get a lot of joy out of seeing other people go from not understanding something, to mastery. I also find educational technology fascinating. I'm currently developing a web application to help children visualize and better understand common core subtraction methods through a cashier game.

My top three interests within technology are: Database Administrator because it allows to manage a company or corporation’s data. Telecommunications: This type of technology makes information transmission easier linking people around the world. Finally, I am passionate about computing because it has become imperative in the working domain everywhere.

I'm interested by the product management because thanks to the technology the company manager could develop some strategies that successful lead the products. It also impoves the team communication and between the company and customers. In addition i like the artificial intelligence because thanks to the technology, we can make any kind of researches we want in a short time where the human being should take a long time. And finally technology made the world a planetary village where we are all closed. I'm talking about the social networks that favor the people connection.

1. Effective use of Social Media - I want to know the effective strategies to do a better advocacy in such a way that people will be interested to my cause on Disability. 2. Graphic Design - The mind behind designing a logo or producing an artwork which I can use in my advocacy work for my project on the welfare of persons with disabilities. 3. Website - I want to learn on how to build a website without using code to showcase my project work on persons with disabilities.

Top 3 fields of interest: • Design • Software development • Network security I'm especially interested in software development. After college, my dream career is to develop software for students with learning disabilities. School can be significantly more challenging for students with learning disabilities. With the right software at their fingertips, students with learning disabilities will be more likely to succeed than if they didn't have this software.

My top 3 fields of interests are artificial technology, software development, and bioinformatics. I would like to develop an artificial intelligence that would help run the world a little better and make lives more convenient. I like building software, so I am also interested in being in software development. I am also interested in bioinformatics because I have started as a biology major and switched majors to Computer Science. I would like to combine those two interests together and work in industry related to the two fields.

Cybertherapy, software development, and virtual reality. Although I am new to the tech world, I love the limitless possibilities and creativity associated with developing tech solutions to address mental health. Currently, everything I am learning in my coding bootcamp and at college is focused on mental health solutions, and this summer I will be developing software for cybertherapy purposes. In the future, as I develop my skills and experience in tech and dive deeper into the tech world, I hope to explore and work in the virtual reality world to help provide VR solutions to the mental health industry.

I am interested software engineering, design, product management in ascending order. I just love software engineering with its approach to developing, operating, and managing software; this is my intended concentration under applied computer science at GMU. After that, I am interested in design because it is important for logos, websites, mobile apps, and the list goes on. Finally, product management is key as a business perspective of the process of working on a project.

I am studying statistics at NYU and majored in economics and minored in art at Smith College. I'm very interested in data science and predictive analysis. In addition, because of my background in arts, I'm also interested in UX research.

Web design, application development, computer programming.

I am interested in becoming a front-end engineer, full-stack engineer, and would love to work in a large company but am also open to startups. I have a background in IT but when I moved to the US I discovered computer programming through free online tools like Codeacademy and that sparked my passion that I could not only fix and build computers but program how they run.

Software Development Specifically with Mobile development and Operating System. I realize those are two very different fields but I like working on UI of an application as well work on the operating system to optimize and make the best out of the hardware available to use for the ease of further devopment.

Being blind, there have been many challenges that I have had to overcome (shshshsh, we don't talk about them) but there have also been a lot of solutions. I think it's important for an individual with a disability to foster that mindset of finding solutions and not giving up, rather than complaining about the system; I would like to advise a mentee in how to apply this principal in daily situations; and generally gaining confidence.

I can help with ICT skills, career planning and personality development.

graphic design, web design, owning a design business (freelance & small virtual studio). Portfolio box above was not working for me - here is a link: http: //paonecreative.com/




I'm the creative type of guy that likes execution and precise results. I would say that my main interest is in marketing and viral usage of content creation to build brand leverage and bring value to the world. I'm not really into the technical side of things, but I love IoT infrastructures and how they collide together to bring a no-delay user experience in finance. It's peculiar to see how nowadays, a simple tap on the phone can send thousands to someone in another country, across bridges and oceans. I love to bring ideas to life, bring concepts to another dimension and make people believe in their capabilities of achieving. It is the human factor and correlation with solving problems with innovative solutions that brings me passion and the willing to push forward.

Software Development- Specifically anything with a strong emphasis on mathematics, which happens to be my favorite subject. I enjoy writing code, I am still a beginner and want to better my skills. Artificial Intelligence- I am very interested in autonomous vehicles design and the social/economical implications. Software Development- Specifically the development of music software. I enjoy creating music, and would like to be involved in producing an educational software program.

My main areas of interest are design and product management. I know how important hearing aids and other devices are to those, like me, who require them. I'd like to do everything I can to make these devices more accessible and user-friendly for all. I don't know whether that means building assistive devices that can be used with conventional hearing aids, building tools that can help people with cognitive challenges or poor dexterity to better use their hearing aids, or completely rethinking what hearing aids are and how they are used - perhaps its a combination of all of the above.

Product Management Marketing (everything digital) People & Community Management Web development Graphic Design

I am majoring in Data Science and Statistics, and so far my studies have focused on impact evaluation through regression and matching. I'm really passionate about this area because I believe that all great programs, policies and plans come about through proper evaluation and control. There are so many things that we could improve on in the world by measuring them and adapting our actions to strengthen positive impact. I want to work on impact evaluation problems in order to improve systems of healthcare, crime prevention and education, to add insights to counter terrorism, to expand a growing and dynamic field, and to work with some amazing people. Other areas of interest for me in technology are the applications to education. I am especially interested in how we can build systems of adaptive learning that benefit students and teachers, bringing in my knowledge and experience in the field of education to my developing skills in technology. Other than that, I am more than willing to explore a whole variety of subsections of the technology field. As a member of the first graduating class at Minerva Schools at KGI, a university driven by technology and innovation, I am constantly exposed to new areas of interest. I have spent the last three weeks as a sounding board for my roommate, who is working on a really cool deep learning project, and I have loved hearing all about it, learning the concepts, researching so that I can be more helpful, and suggesting new directions they could take their work. I love to hear about and learn new things in this sphere, and I'm eager to connect with mentors in this program so that I can solidify my interests into projects and curricula with the aim of teaching myself more.

The way people understand things like visual design, motion, product design fascinates me. These elements are evolving in tech at a fast pace, and new elements are created with the addition of new technologies. The languages a person speaks and the cultures they are apart of and their role in societies are factors that can effect the way people interact with technology. The challenge of designing for a multitude of variables excites me. This is why UX design and research interest me the most. Tech-healthcare is another strong area of interest for me. The main reason I am eager to apply UX design and research to tech-healthcare is that I believe everyone deserves access to amazing healthcare. To do so, healthcare professionals need to have access to the best tech in order to provide optimal healthcare. Issues like sound design across multiple devices and at home testing kits are just a few tech based healthcare issues that fascinate me as a UXer.

Game development, software development and product management. My current research interest is developing educational video games. My current dissertation focus is on developing educational video games to teach Deaf and Hard of Hearing students to learn undergraduate statistics.

1, Coding - My dad has lots of friends designated as programmer at place like Boeing, Microsoft and Realter.ca 2, Networking - What I am doing currently. I am good at implementation and troubleshooting technology Quantum information

I'd love to help people 1) improve their interaction design skills, 2) improve their visual design skills, and 3) help coach people on how to talk about their design work.

My top 3 fields of expertise are 1) Design research, 2) the informal economy, 3) Digital financial inclusion. Through my startup I have accumulated a deep knowledge base around the drivers that influence design and user research decisions. At Mastercard, I had the opportunity to learn about the many hurdles as well digital solutions addressing the pain points of underbanked consumers in low-resource communities and disenfranchised populations confronted by opaque systems. Broadly speaking, I want to help my future mentee successfully navigate ambiguity. Success in technology is defined by identifying opportunities and executing on them better than the status quo – often, there is no playbook for what this looks like because it’s never been done before. I want to coach my mentee to be creative, resourceful, and ambitious – in other words, entrepreneurial. I also want to challenge my mentee to think critically about their goals, clearly articulate their vision, and attack the best-fitting opportunities.

"The realization that you are different from other people and therefore need to work harder or push yourself further in certain areas can be a tough one. I had to work to slowly learn how to feel comfortable in my own skin again. I learned how important it is to have a safe space to grow, learn, and fail without judgement, and how to ask and accept help from others. Three skills I’d love to help my mentee develop are: resilience, scrappiness, and empathy. If the key to a successful product/idea/startup/anything is to fail fast and fail often, resilience is what lets you do that without becoming discouraged. Resilience is recognizing that failure is a learning experience to be treasured and continuing to put yourself out of your comfort zone. One of the core values at Rent the Runway (where I am currently a Product Designer) is, “Scrappiness is a virtue.� Circumstances will rarely be perfect- instead of waiting for the ideal resources or ideal situation, build whatever you can to get the job done. Finally, empathy is one of the best qualities to have in the field of tech, but also perhaps the rarest. Connecting with people and understanding their needs is a core part of my job as a UX designer, but has also helped me in so many other areas of my personal and professional lives. "

1. Evaluative research to inform design 2. Generative research to inform design 3. Helath-specific technologies

Program Management: ITIL, Operations, Marketing, Incident Management, Problem Management, Communications Impact and influence, communications, presentations, email methods, consulting I personally do not have a degree but have been successful at Microsoft and other technology companies.

Software developer, artificial intelligence and data science

I chose to study engineering because I wanted to pursue a professional path that involves commitment to others. A field that, via scientific research and implementation, enables future generations to thrive. I am especially interested in Software, AI, machine learning, Finance and economics. However, each time I try a new thing I discover more interesting things, so I would like to try other fields as well. I am also interested in starting my own company/ start-up one day. I participated in Start-Up French Taglit, a special program which acquaints Franco-Jewish entrepreneurs with Israel and focuses on the technology aspect of Israel by visiting many leading start-ups and meeting eminent figures like Shimon Peres. This program opened my eyes to the extent of Israeli innovations in the technology industry and certainly gave me a taste for more.

My top 3 fields of interest within technology are biotechnology/biomedical technology, data science and machine learning, and software development. I am passionate about biomedical technology because I have studied and worked in the healthcare sector and can see the gaps in current infrastructure and treatment. I am inspired by biopharmaceuticals and devices for the amelioration of human disease and hope to use the program that I am in to continue to support my interests. Data science and machine learning fascinate me because I believe that they are pivotal components in every industry and have infinite applications. The fields are constantly evolving and I would love to learn about how someone with no experience can get started. Software Development is an exponentially growing industry that is the backbone of every successful company or organization. I realize that coding knowledge is a highly valued skill and want to be involved to begin learning coding and apply my health background to the industry.

Assistive technologies such as screen reader software, hardware equipment which assists persons with disabilities, artificial intelligence including automation technologies and neural networks which can enhance text to speech software, navigation aids etc. and big data.

I am passionate about improving health through technology. For me, there are two main forms this takes, one through improving healthcare and products centered around improving health and the other is through more "clinical" applications such as using data to improve diagnostics, or using modeling to study proteins. I am interested in using data in both of these space to identify and understand and develop solutions that improve quality of life.

In my opinion, the tech industry as a whole is the new Wall Street. Meaning that the top jobs/opportunities is now in a completely new and exciting industry. I am extremely interested in startups/venture creations, sports technology and innovation, and social media. 1. The reason why I am intrigued with start ups is because my roommate is currently working on one himself. The creative thinking involved and the potential reward makes me very curious about working within a start up. 2. As a big sports fan in 2017, I find that just with any other industry things evolve, mostly for the better. And sports is not exception to that. I'm interested in seeing first hand how technology can better sports as a whole. And what's in involved in that whole aspect. 3. Finally, I am interested in a social media platform because I see firsthand on a college campus the overall importance of maintaining a strong presence on social media. And what really intrigues me is that this whole concept of having social media platforms online is only about 10 or so years old. And now it is extremely popular and I think it will continue to be extremely successful. So I'd be curious to learn the ideologies behind the overall success and contrary to that, mistakes that companies have made.

I am a senior majoring in chemistry who has developed passion for analytics and is ready to apply it in tackling real life challenges. My top interests include data science in healthcare, oil and gas, or clean technology industry. I also have an interest in materials science and nanotechnologies, as I believe they could provide solutions to many urging problems. I am open to new opportunities.

My main interest in technology within engineering. My major at WSU is Biomedical Engineering and I think this is very interesting and can help improve the lives of others. Within engineering I think regenerative medicine is where my main interest and focus for my future career will be. I also think assistive technology is also bery interesting, along with prosthetics.

I'm deeply interested in data science, data analytics, M&E and using needs assessments and collected data to determine the needs of communities and prepare technological platforms accordingly.

I am interested in artificial intelligence, software development, and app development. I recently developed an interest in these areas from self-learning about the technological shift during the last century and current developments. With an aging and growing population, there is an increasing demand for efficiency to balance these changes. However, these areas are only in their early stages of development and further research will be required to create applications for everyday life. My goal is to combine technology and computer science with my lifelong interest in psychology (mental health and cognition) and life sciences. I would like to innovate applications that can be used in everyday life and help society as a whole. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and plan to continue my studies in computer science.

1) Science. I am a chemist by training, and am enthralled by the world of science. Overlap between science and technology excites me. It provides unique opportunities to transition academic inventions into the commercial world. The overlap of science and technology is broad, but I don't want to narrow it down to avoid limiting this field. I am interested in all areas at the intersection of science and technology, including biotechnology, energy, data science, machine learning, and many others. I do not have formal training in software, but would love to contribute to science and technology. 2) Education. The Internet provides amazing opportunities for everyone to learn. Individuals can take online classes, learn skills through videos, join a mentoring program, and read research articles. As Nelson Mandela said, "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." I believe technology is poised to change education and I wish to be a part of that movement. 3) Social Networking. Technology has vastly changed the way we communicate, with no foreseeable end to ever-changing communication. I am most interested in scientific communication via social networks because of my background. Several websites have tried to becoming the "Facebook for scientists," including academia.edu, researchgate.net, and others. However, these sites have not succeeded. I think scientists could greatly benefit from increased communication and collaboration within the community. They have been relatively slow to uptake technological changes, but new technologies could prompt adoption.

Technology is certainly quite broad, and quite accurately reflects the breadth of my interests. However, if I had to choose my top three, I would have to say design (product, UI/UX, graphic, CAD), VR, and games. I can go on a huge tangent about how games, VR, and CAD could merge into a whole new way we interact with the digital world, but to be honest I can't really say I have enough concrete information really say. I like to create and speculate, which is why I enjoy conceptual design and examining technology from a more philosophical point of view. I guess what really makes me excited about technology is that it presents to me so many possible outlets to let my imagination out and bring my creations to life.

Technology has played a very powerful role in my life by providing me with tools that have increased my independence and autonomy. This is why I am so passionate about advocating for the use of high technology in this way and am fascinated by a broad range of technological realms. I’m interested in Accessibility because it combines my passion for technology with my passion for advocating for the needs of people with disabilities. I’m interested in User Experience/User Interface because these impact how people interact with technology. I want to create user experiences that make it easier for people with disabilities to use technology. I’m also very interested in emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, Augmented/Virtual Reality, and home automation, because of the incredible amounts of potential these technologies have to enhance people's lives in a positive way. I want to help shape how these technologies are used by people with disabilities.

Accessibility, web development. Technology is something I use everyday.

Business development. Fundraising. Startup experience. I've been running our startup for 4 years, have raised $360,000 and I would love to help someone avoid the pitfalls we encountered along the way. Navigating startup challenges, provide a sounding board.

As a fairly recent graduate with the experience of working for two large technology companies, Salesforce and Microsoft. I feel confident with mentoring on Strategy / Process Building , Technology Products, Problem Solving / SWOT Analysis. I am also passionate about entrepreneurships and startups. I would be able to provide mentorship on the process of internships and getting full time roles in the technology industry. I also believe I would connect to students who are passionate about learning about new technologies as much as I am.

Computer hardware at scale- data centers, HPC, etc. Network infrastructure and concepts Basic programming




I am interested in virtual reality and game development, particularly in building environments. I have been working on small projects within the Unity and Unreal Engine, having taught myself how to create 3D environments and assets.

Utilizing technology in product design. Utilizing technology to communicate ideas. Utilizing technology gain knowledge.

I have an interest in biomedical technology. Specifically, I want to get into 3D printed prosthetics, Tissue regeneration (minimum invasive, rapid wound healing) and mobile health apps (patient centered focused). As someone who has been in the healthcare system and a per-engineering student, I wanted to do my part to decrease costs and stress to patients and their families. I also want to find ways to lower the disparity in healthcare access. The technologies I have mentioned all have potential to attack these problems.

Film/TV, Video Games, And Virtual reality. I have a big passion for 3D modelling in particular because it allows me to create things that are unique and out of my imagination. I love the way I can dissect objects to find out how they are built.

Technology ties into my passion because technology provides opportunities which empower disadvantaged individuals in society such as minorities or individuals with disabilities such as myself. In other industries, such as banking or film, there is more of a barrier to entry specific to disadvantaged individuals by precluding those without the proper credentials such as a formal education or connections. Though it has its own share of diversity problems, the tech industry is nonetheless one of the few industries where there is a strong and active movement in attempting to include people from all backgrounds. By its nature, technology seeks to recruit the best and brightest, regardless of race, gender, and disabilities. I am passionate about tech because I believe in its potential to unify people from all backgrounds with the shared focus of building things that better the community. Within technology, my strongest interest is undoubtedly coding. There’s an ineffable joy to creating something out of nothing and building it while optimizing for form and function. Though I am an engineer at heart, the product in its entirety remains a strong interest for me. I code because I want to be involved in the hands-on process of building something that provides some value to end-users. Beyond the actual engineering, however, there is a myriad of questions that must be considered when formulating product development, including what specific problem does it seek to address or how should this product scale over the long term. Through my previous software engineering internship at Ticketmaster, I realized that I enjoy building products that everyday people such as you or me can benefit from. Ideally, I want to work on a back-end, full-stack, or mobile development team responsible for building a consumer-facing platform that leverages the sharing economy or crowd-sourcing to provide value for the end-users. An example might be Uber which allows peer-to-peer ride-sourcing transactions or TripAdvisor which generates content, in the form of reviews, through crowd-sourcing.

I'm big on editorial content, mobile strategy and product development. I've been a long-time team builder and manager -- I could be most helpful in professional development, team dynamics, etc.

Anything related to disability

Cloud technologies, mobile technologies, and imaging - would love to guide mentee on understanding technology lifecycle and go-to-market for products.




"From my school days I was fascinated by computers and its applications. When I used Screen Reader (JAWS) for very first time I was surprised that software’s can bring revolutionary change in Life. As I was in school where students only can opt for Humanities, I tried my school management to allow me to opt for Science and Math. Unfortunately they were not convinced. I qualified the exam of one of the university which allow non-science background student to pursue bachelor’s degree in Computer Application, I continued and pursued Master’s in Computer Application from one of the reputed engineering college in India. Interests: Programming Developing Applications to solve day-to-day problems. Tech for Social good) Big Billion Impact) to make human life easier. "

AI, I'm interested in this aspect before philosophy and my other fields of studies used to be in cognitive science until linguistics of all courses throttled me. It's a field of study that'll change society in the future. High tech in general, that's how I got into 3D printing even though I'm an arts students. Programming, attempted it in both high school and university, want to learn more about them, not very good at them.

Software development- After helping build a software for organizing the data from a cosmic ray detecting software at my university's physics lab, I wish pursue more projects in software development. The entire process of creating a software by myself was very rewarding. Data science, processing and analysis - Again working with large data from the cosmic ray detectors, it was amazing to manipulate these large amounts of data and draw conclusions from them. Video editing and graphics design - I self taught myself the Adobe Suite and starting taking small projects in my university for the student run news site and TEDx Video Team

I have a particular passion for designing and developing web and mobile applications because here in Africa there are a lot of problems that we can solve with just a single application (for example reminding a mother to take her child to the Hospital for immunization). I also like cybersecurity because it's really exciting.

Artificial intelligence is a big interest of mine. While abroad at Oxford, I studied computational neuroscience. I loved it. We used Matlab and I loved the feeling of getting the model to fit the data. After studying the brain for years now, I appreciate its complexity. Artificial intelligence is a form of applied computational neuroscience that tackles this complexity in a unique way that can benefit the population. Data analysis is another interest of mine. I love data analysis because it can be used to study anything. For example, while doing behavioral economic projects at the Harvard Kennedy School we used STATA to analyze water usage in California and bus safety in Kenya. Data analysis is also key in effectively contributing factual information in the sciences. Ultimately, the versatility of data analysis and its ability to conform to whatever interest I have is its biggest draw. My third top interest is software development. This is of interest to me because it seems to be the most practical aspect of computer science. It's the best way to turn an idea into reality. It also is incredibly fun to be successful at turning those ideas into actuality.

My first two interests are related in that I am passionate about them for the same reason. They are programming and hardware. I delight in these because I love to build things. To be able to start with basic parts(whether code or components), and build something that is complex and elegant, this is joy for me. Lastly, I am passionate about design. I have always been artistic and appreciated aesthetics. Bringing these things together into one career would be a dream come true.

artifitial intelligence, scientific data, and design.

As a consultant working with Children, Parents, Government, Schools, Institutes, Universities , NGOs is being blessed with many opportunities. The opportunities to list include, technology enabling in regular classroom routines, accessible resource material creation and distribution, training and support on assistive technology, advocacy for accessible environment, guidance and counselling for livelihood opportunities




Product Management: I like being able to manage various moving pieces to bring an idea to life making sure important problems are being solved for stakeholders. Business Strategy: I am able to look at the bigger picture for various problems and enjoy solving problems by allocating the appropriate resources. Healthcare Technology: Being able to have a deep impact on countless people excites me, and working with healthcare technology would allow me to find opportunities and challenges that can be addressed. Within healthcare, being able to work with various technology platforms to better understand the technology that runs powerful software systems.

my top 3 fields of interest in technology are adaptive technology products, consumer outreach, and software design. Users with disabilities are often singled out of opportunities because of the lack of accessibility to assistive technology. Mentoring done by people passionate about tech is what drives a young disabled person to embrace the beauty of using technology in their daily lives. Tech is what helped me succeed in all aspects, especially education. With the innovative invention of mobile technology like thee Apple iPhone, I am able to view the world full of opportunities with a clear eye. My interest in adaptive tech stems from my experience with usage and the support received by educators who specialized in teaching students on how to use assistive software like VoiceOver, Jaws For Windows, etc. With the growing interest in artificial intelligence, people with disabilities can become more independent and productive.

I'm very interested in accessibility/mobility technology. I'd like to be involved in a marketing, product management or business development role.

Front and Full-Stack Development especially in SPA(Single Paged Application) wither MEAN or MERN stack.

"I'm passionate about making the life of others easier through Technology. I love how you can make something amazing from scratch with very little tools, an idea, and a small device"

I work in Diversity & Inclusion and plan on continuing in this field. A mentor that is in a similar function is less important to me than someone who can help with my challenges.

1) VR & AR. As a graduate psychology student I’m most excited about the clinical uses of virtual and augmented reality. Two separate tools capable of transporting or altering one’s perspective reality have profound implications for the medical field. Improving from pixelated graphics, digital realties can help patients cope with a variety of disabilities, fears and lived experiences. As a cultural psychologist, I’m interested in VR specifically for the possibility to reduce racism and prejudice amongst treated patients. Previous studies have shown that when people of opposite views, races and cultures work together prejudice can be reduced (Allport, 1954). While Allport and other’s have found this contact theory effective, I find that scalability is lacking. Therefore, I believe that VR has the capability of exposing mass amounts of individuals to situations and cultures that they have yet to experience. Thus, I’m passionate about digital realities because they offer a practical and scalable option for both clinical and field studies. 2) Automated Marketing. As a past marketer for non-profit, startup, real estate and a fortune 500 company, marketing has been a passion of mine. Mixed with psychology and a performing arts background, I’ve found marketing to be an outlet for both creativity and innovation. I’m passionate about the way in which automated marketing software is enhancing and enabling companies to reach both specific and interested markets. Specifically, within my time at Intuit I found that responsive pages, direct A/B tests and intelligent emails are certainly the next phase in digital marketing. 3) The internet of things. I’m passionate about the ever-increasing connectivity of our digital and physical world. From Nest, smart refrigerators, smarter lights to intelligent kitchens, I’m passionate about the way in which companies working together to innovate and jointly bring technological progress to consumers and companies alike. It excites me to think about that ways in which interconnected technology has the potential to make life easier for people and lessen the cost of simply living.

I've always been passionate about studying the universe and space travel. I'm a fan of star trek, and I hope that society can reach such fantastic heights as in the show. Technology is the only way to achieve that . I'm interested in artificial intelligence, computational science, and robotics. I would love to make a contribution in at least one of those areas some day.

I am a new software engineer at Capital One, and have my own educational website, MusicAlgo.com which uses animated lectures and music to help beginners in CS learn fundamental ideas. If I had to choose my top 3 areas I would like to focus on they would be 1) application development 2) data analysis and machine learning 3) distributed computing At the end of the day I want to make apps and websites that help solve people's problems and make their lives better. Given the copious amounts of data that we have now, machine learning is a technique that will be leveraged to make good applications great, by adjusting to its users and improving with historical data. None of this is possible though without utilizing the parallel and distributed computing technologies that will make this analysis possible in a reasonable amount of time.

My passion for technology helps me strive to make tasks easier for myself and others. I would like to streamline processes by advancing my skills in coding, creating new apps and enhance disability features in these apps and websites. I want to create features that integrate voiceover, Siri and other descriptive features. I believe there has to be some way to have descriptive audio for movies automated similar to adding a close caption track.

I'm interested in what technology can do for me. I have a passion for photography but going blind puts limits on my abilities. Technology us made it so I don't have to have the perfect eye.

IT Helpdesk Technician iOS Developer Data Science

Embedded Engineering seems to be my strongest suit, I believe I was at my peak of usefulness when I was heavily performing hardware testing on what would see release as the ViewPlus Columbia embosser, while contributing small updates to the firmware repository (a locally hosted Subversion, thus why I used a trick to leave the GitHub field effectively blank.) The programming languages I seem to be the best at are those that use the Function Block Diagram model, which is strongly evidenced by me developing a major component, as well as directing and performing component integration, on the EV3 code used for a team project in the Microsoft Autism Program. While it's not as glorious of a route as engineering or programming, I seem to have an intuition for systems administration and quality assurance. I've been upgrading computer hardware since 2003, and building from scratch since 2011. This has led to me troubleshooting PC issues for friends and family since around 2005, and on rare occasion help others out with Android and iOS devices as well. While Windows (3.1 through 10, most of my experience is with XP, 7, 10, and a few private alpha releases of 10TH2 and 10RS1) is the OS I typically deal with, I have some experience working with macOS (7.1 through 10.11) and Linux (mostly Debian-based but I'm starting to use Arch derivatives as well).

"I am interested in the application of computer science and big data to chronic illness. As more advanced medical diagnostics become available to patients at lower cost (such as microbiome and genome sequencing), the possibility of accessible personalized medicine increases. While this might in the future have monumental academic impacts, such as researching new gene-specialized medication, right now the benefits of these advances are not reaching those who need it. I am interested in compassionate big data, where I can value the personal integrity of those who share my experiences with chronic illness. This might be finding dietary choices which work for sufferers of IBD with a common gene, or gym exercises which relieve the pain of those with rheumatoid arthritis. I spoke recently with an engineer who works at a pharmacy who deliver specialized medication, about how they could connect customer feedback on the efficacy of their medication with genome analysis to start tailoring dose based on genetic makeup. Applications such as this fascinate me, but I am also generally interested in the field of human interaction with big data - channeling this new trend towards utility for the public. My technical interests could be listed as follows: Application of computer science to health. Biotechnology. Big data software engineering."

"Going into college, I did not intend to study Computer Science. Thus, technology allows me to experience how it is to discover and be passionate about a new area. It assists me in broadening my horizons and to approach problems from both a structured and analytical perspective as well as giving room to be creative when looking at real-life issues. Software engineering, is probably most closely related to my current courses. I want to learn more about cybersecurity and data science, but as of now my experience in these areas is limited. "

Empowering people from all walks of life. Technology helps open many doors which many times f2f conversations don't, because people judge very easily. I love to help people explore their potential and guide them through their journey of achievements big and small
