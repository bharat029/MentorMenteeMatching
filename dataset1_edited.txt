Eden Bensaid MenteeApplicationMIT - major:  computer science and engineering + minor:  finance?Female?Disability:  IBS - Irritable bowel syndrome, I have an almost daily abdominal pain + ADHD ?Cambridge?16th Dec, 1992
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: I chose to study engineering because I wanted to pursue a professional path that involves commitment to others. A field that, via scientific research and implementation, enables future generations to thrive. I am especially interested in Software, AI, machine learning, Finance and economics. However, each time I try a new thing I discover more interesting things, so I would like to try other fields as well. I am also interested in starting my own company/ start-up one day. I participated in Start-Up French Taglit, a special program which acquaints Franco-Jewish entrepreneurs with Israel and focuses on the technology aspect of Israel by visiting many leading start-ups and meeting eminent figures like Shimon Peres. This program opened my eyes to the extent of Israeli innovations in the technology industry and certainly gave me a taste for more. 

Goal: Since I'm an international student, with no family in the US and no background in a technical field (my family is from the medicine field), I am desperately looking for a mentor who can help me to pave my way in the industry. I need help in everything from industry knowledge stuff:  such as choosing my classes, planning my summers, networking and interviewing skills to technical knowledge like CS skills. I think I especially need help in things that didn't even cross my mind yet. 

Challenge & Disability:  The IBS started about 3 years ago, but I don't let it affect my career goals or my routine in any way. I did changed my diet, I am taking a daily treatment for it and regular blood tests to check my health (especially lost of vitamins since I had anemia). The symptoms aggravate under stress, so I try to remain calm and plan my schedule in advance as much as I can. Regarding the ADHD, I was diagnosed when I was 13 , and since I didn't have to study a lot in high school it didn't bother me much then. At MIT, with the fast paced classes it is much harder. To cope I am going to all extra tutoring hours and always ask questions. I am having the hardest time in CS labs, where we need to finish coding in a relatively short amount of time. Therefore, my top 3 challenges are:  Fast-paced classes, that will only get harder over the years, distracting abdominal pain - sometimes pain so strong that it wakes me up at night, and Accomplishing coding tasks in short intervals of time. 

Preference: I don't have any special preference, just someone who cares and wants to help : )

Personality: I am a positive and smiley person, who know when to work hard nd when to have fun : P

Kevin Assam MenteeApplicationCurrently on a sophomore leave of absence and am searching for alternative universities to continue my higher-education.?Male?Disability:  I suffer from the effects of previous and severe bouts of Blepharoconjunctivitis. This threatened to impair my sight and has left current symptoms of extra-photosensitivity, strained vision, increased susceptibility to contracting bacterial infections, and overproduction of fluids around the eye. ?Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago?5th October, 1994
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: User experience is key. Whether it’s for a concept like the Blue Line Pill or a revolutionary piece of software that assists the visually impaired in classrooms, users will not return if there is not a smooth and enjoyable interaction. I am particularly keen on incorporating more technology within classroom instruction, for example. Yet, I fear that so many products, even a Smart Board, easily frustrate users and motivate them to turn to more outdated but stable items to help teach students. This makes user experience a crucial target in technology. Design is equally important. There’s a reason Steve Jobs cautioned us to make the back of the picket fence as pretty as the front. Aesthetically, an item’s design is its window to its “soul.� It’s the first thing we use to make snap judgments and is ultimately responsible for encouraging or dissuading us to reach out and interact with an object. Design is a universal language. You do not need to speak a specific dialect to appreciate the beauty or ergonomics of a product. For those reasons, emphasis on design is crucial to engineering well received and innovative ideas. Finally, I am interested in the DIY elements of technology as it relates to the easier manufacturing of items. Take the rise of “Fab Labs� or the exponential growth of 3D Printing. These have all made it possible to learn lean production processes or even cut out traditional middle men distributors. From manufacture to the point of sale, these DIY capabilities have now truly made it possible conduct all business processes from one location. Importantly, I view this as an important movement to reduce costs associated barriers to entry in tech.

Goal: I would ideally love to work with my mentor to sift through the ideas I have and better determine which ones are more feasible and worth spending our time exploring. That said, one possibility is my Blue Line Pill. This is a liquid-gel capsule that would sanitize liquid waste deposits in toilets and other waste removal mechanisms. By purifying the waste, it aims to curtail the need to flush or use a large and disproportionate amount of fresh water to eliminate said waste. It would be targeted towards communities that routinely suffer from water shortages. The pill would offer a way to immediately aid water conservation while long term infrastructural changes are hopefully put into the works. Another potential idea is DemocracyTT. This currently is in the beta form of a website that aims to compile the most updated and relevant information on elected officials so as to simplify the process of constituents contacting members of parliament. The Caribbean as a whole often shrouds such pertinent information and makes it very difficult to easily access members of the government. DemocracyTT’s objective is to eliminate such a barrier. Consequentially, learning how to build the right relationships with members of relevant industries and meaningfully contributing to their needs as well as my own would be great skills to refine throughout this process. In addition, figuring out how to best build out the first iteration of the previously mentioned projects would afford me the practical know withal to tackle other ventures that may arise out of this program. Elements like product design and being able to navigate the pitfalls of a lack of immediate funding are specific areas I can imagine gaining knowledge within.

Challenge & Disability:  You know what’s difficult? Try avoiding direct sunlight because it feels like your eyes are on fire. Equally cumbersome is writing an exam with just one eye open while you pray for another fifteen minutes of solid vision. Blepharoconjunctivitis threatened to permanently impair my sight. Years of misdiagnosis by poorly implemented medical practices left me with scarring on the surface of my eyes. You couldn’t see them with the naked eye, but I excruciatingly felt them. By the time I received an accurate diagnosis, my options were limited. Each began with indefinite treatments involving rarely effective and expensive prescriptions. Accordingly, I made what seemed like a reckless decision. I chose to find my own medical alternative. This would not be the total end of my sight. After conducting research and speaking to various Ophthalmologists, I recognized that mechanical cleansing (i.e. by hand) of the eyes might be a viable option. With no products locally available to achieve this, I set out to create my own. I explored everything from traditional Chinese tea extracts to salt water concoctions before finally tweaking a mixture that seemed to be just right. Months of cautiously testing this on my own eyes enabled me to refine this liquid-based solution and devise a daily regime that significantly reduced flare-ups. Not only did this improve my level of health, but it also taught me that even the slightest improvement is better than none. Yes, I do continue to experience occasional bouts of this affliction and there are symptoms I am still working to address. However, by taking back control of a small but crucial component of my life, I became swept up in a rewarding process that now allows me to potentially assist others suffering from this chronic ailment. Oddly enough, my challenges are less to do with my own disability and more connected to the environment. The Caribbean is just beginning to develop its pool of entrepreneurs and with that comes the growing pains of slowly building a network of innovators and mentors. A huge appeal in applying to NextBillion is my intent to fill this void by making the necessary connections. Much like lined-up dominos, it takes just one to fall to clear the way for the others. I think this sentiment holds true with finding people who are willing to help you in your venture. A single person can lead to another and on and on. It’s a virtuous cycle of helping others. There’s also the issue of developing ideas in an environment that is politically and financially destabilizing by the day. It’s no secret that the Caribbean and Americas are struggling to achieve their developed region goal. Speaking with someone who can teach me how to leverage what looks like a bad situation and make it work in my favor will be priceless. Lastly, I can sometimes have a hard time when it comes to successfully pitching myself and my ideas. Working on my communications skills is another invaluable area that I hope to begin improving with my mentor. 

Preference: I would love to have a mentor who is progressive and willing to entertain even the most far-fetched of ideas because so often it is through a strong mentorship that products and inventions can be refined and evolve into their eventual best versions. In terms of location – anyone who has had the experience of growing up in a small town before moving on to penetrate a metropolitan market may be of particular use given the gap that tends to divide communities like the Caribbean from other regions. I am also looking to balance work in the creative fields with technical skillsets. A mentor of similar traits would be quite helpful. Truly, I’m an open book and am looking forward to meet whichever individual I am matched with.

Personality: My ability to push past adversity and devise the most unconventional of solutions to tackle everyday problems makes me someone you will definitely remember.

Referral: Facebook:  Under 30 Changemakers Group

Other: I think if you look at my background, the adversity I have triumphed over, and my willpower and determination to keep going, you will recognize that I am someone who, with the right guidance, can transform my ideas into fully blown mediums of change. I have a personality that is both focused and yet, at the same time, is capable of making you laugh. I am the type of person that you want to have around at that 4AM group meeting or that moment when the going gets rough. I definitely believe in the notion that life is all about taking chances and sometimes taking the unlikeliest of paths to get to where you need to be. So take a chance with me. You just might find it to be all the worthwhile. Don't let the fact that I'm not based in the US get in the way. It might be a great opportunity to diversify the pool of NextBillion mentees.

Priscilla Garces MenteeApplicationI recently graduated from Fordham University with a Master of Science in Nonprofit Leadership/Development?Female?Disability:  I am totally blind due to Retinopathy of Prematurity?Union, New Jersey?04/11/1987
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: my top 3 fields of interest in technology are adaptive technology products, consumer outreach, and software design. Users with disabilities are often singled out of opportunities because of the lack of accessibility to assistive technology. Mentoring done by people passionate about tech is what drives a young disabled person to embrace the beauty of using technology in their daily lives. Tech is what helped me succeed in all aspects, especially education. With the innovative invention of mobile technology like thee Apple iPhone, I am able to view the world full of opportunities with a clear eye. My interest in adaptive tech stems from my experience with usage and the support received by educators who specialized in teaching students on how to use assistive software like VoiceOver, Jaws For Windows, etc. With the growing interest in artificial intelligence, people with disabilities can become more independent and productive.

Goal: I would like to accomplish several things during this year. Some of my future plans involve creating a nonprofit organization that provides education and mentoring for young people. Young kids need guidance to prevent the risk of dropping out of school. Teens with disabilities are especially vulnerable because they face additional challenges concerning acceptance. Other goals to accomplish would be to have a stable source of employment and network better. People with disabilities have a harder time networking because society focuses more on their disability rather than their ability. Most people with disabilities easily fall into depression because of the struggles they face when finding employment and overall lack of support. 

Challenge & Disability:  Every day is an ongoing challenge starting with the simple task of taking a short walk alone with the constant worry of getting lost and not finding the way home. The main challenges I face every day relates to continued professional growth, career development and acceptance in the labor market. Even though I have the right skill set and qualifications, it is very hard to find suitable employment in the industries I chose to advance my career. I have had prior internships in both the nonprofit industry and government sector. I worked at various organizations for brief periods of time due to constraints in terms of full-time hiring. Some of the organizations I worked fore include the United Nations where I performed research on various topics like sustainable development, economic development, and human rights. While at Philantropia Inc, a world-leading nonprofit consulting firm, I worked as an evaluator of web design for donors willing to donate to organizations around the world. I evaluated user accessibility of the website and researched alternative materials for potential organizers with disabilities who run nonprofits. I also translated various training materials from English to Spanish resulting in market expansion to Latin-America and other parts of the world. Even with prior political experience acquired from working for the US Senate offices, it is a struggle being accepted in the employment field. I am blind since birth and with the use of braille and early exposure to technology, I managed to complete my education and have a unique career experience. 

Preference: my ideal mentor should be a compassionate, caring, wise, and approachable person. He/she should have experience with adaptive technology, work in both the public and private sector. A mentor should be patient, understanding and able to listen and share potential ideas with mentees. they should also motivate and encourage individuals to accomplish their goals, and provide simple solutions or at least guide them if tasks seem challenging.

Personality: My ability to inspire other people, leadership, and enthusiasm make me awesome. 

Referral: Facebook

Other: I would like to meet up with mentors at networking events to discuss my future ideas and concerns.

Jasim Taqi MenteeApplicationI teach myself web development at home?Male?Disability:  Spinal Cord Injury?Oakland, CA?30th Jul, 1984
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: Front End Development - I like the tangibility of front end. You get the satisfaction of feeling like you built something. User Experience - I like the idea of solving the user's problems & giving them value. I see that as the ultimate goal of software. Design - good design is required for good user experience. 

Goal: Basically, I want to get a job. I need to feel like I'm contributing something to my family. My soft skills could definitely use improvement. I tend to fail at whiteboarding or pair-programming type interviews (although I do well with take-home projects). My ability to network is limited, and there is always room for improvement in the technical skills arena. Most of all, it would be wonderful to have someone to bounce ideas off of, who is invested in my success. I taught myself to code online, so I feel insulated a lot of the time. 

Challenge & Disability:  The challenges in my life boil down to 2 things:  being jobless and having a back injury. In the 4 years since my back injury, I haven't worked, I haven't sat in a chair, my social life has disappeared, and I have less physical autonomy. 

Preference: Really smart, experienced, and local

Personality: I'm an extremely hard worker who holds myself to high standards, and I write good, clean code.

By having a mentor I would like to set myself for my future in education to make a choice with the help of the mentor's recommendations.?Male?Disability:  Half blind, glaucoma, born with congenital cataracts, multiple eyes operations, microphthalmia... I now have decent adaptation to see as normally as possible (big glasses or contact lens + glasses, but it causes pain so I give it the least time on a daily period)?Sherbrooke, Quebec?10th Feb, 2000
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: I'm the creative type of guy that likes execution and precise results. I would say that my main interest is in marketing and viral usage of content creation to build brand leverage and bring value to the world. I'm not really into the technical side of things, but I love IoT infrastructures and how they collide together to bring a no-delay user experience in finance. It's peculiar to see how nowadays, a simple tap on the phone can send thousands to someone in another country, across bridges and oceans. I love to bring ideas to life, bring concepts to another dimension and make people believe in their capabilities of achieving. It is the human factor and correlation with solving problems with innovative solutions that brings me passion and the willing to push forward.

Goal: I'd like to learn how small/bigger companies use their resources to take something from 0 to an actual functional product/service; the creative management process. May it be with strategies or mindset. Set a road map for launching a startup, where to start, conception and delivery. I want to make a decision with the future of my education, if I should stop, move to a program in University or gain online knowledge and start a business. Do both? Maybe... I really need some help. I would also love to network for possible work opportunities looking forward.

Challenge & Disability:  It's been a ride! In a major part of high school, I wasn't able to wear a contact lens for my eye that is able to see. As a result, I had (and still have for some days) to wear very extreme glasses that are uncommon. Throughout primary school and high school I've been abused by students and adults that are/were making fun and mocking me by the way it makes me look. I developed social anxiety problem and was in day hospital for 6 months last year, surrounded by psychologists, psychiatrists and others that pretty much saved my life as I was sinking deeper. It has changed me a lot, making me a person that doesn't mind sharing his story hoping that it could help others. Meanwhile, I'm still making multiple efforts to meet people and exchange, as I hadn't really tasted social interactions prior to my trip at the hospital. Now that I'm happier and more confident with my contact lens that removes the usage of the enormous glasses, I am looking forward to speak in public, reach people and influence for the better. In terms of challenge, it is still hard for me to accept my past and show it, although I'm more at ease. I cannot do any fast-pace activities or driving, I need special glasses for the sun as I am missing my crystalline. I still get strange looks because one of my eye is sometimes moving out of it's normal location, diverging from the other.

Preference: I would love someone at @VaynerMedia, Gary V himself? Who knows, he always surprises us with his small moves that have targeted impact. https: //twitter.com/garyvee/status/828640215065571330 Other than that, I don't really have a preference, if the person has experience in their work then that's good. Maybe in a recognized brand too would help me stand out but I don't mind. 

Personality: I will "kill" you with my kindness and make shit happen. (strong vocabulary, but truer than anything)

Referral: Manu Goswami

Other: I may not be currently in university, but I'm confident that I can sufficiently jump the boundary and commit all of my abilities to make this a one-of-a-kind experience that will serve my mentor and me. Please take this into consideration.

Ben Schreiber MenteeApplicationCapital One?male?Disability:  ADHD?Arlington VA?11/23/93
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: I am a new software engineer at Capital One, and have my own educational website, MusicAlgo.com which uses animated lectures and music to help beginners in CS learn fundamental ideas. If I had to choose my top 3 areas I would like to focus on they would be 1) application development 2) data analysis and machine learning 3) distributed computing At the end of the day I want to make apps and websites that help solve people's problems and make their lives better. Given the copious amounts of data that we have now, machine learning is a technique that will be leveraged to make good applications great, by adjusting to its users and improving with historical data. None of this is possible though without utilizing the parallel and distributed computing technologies that will make this analysis possible in a reasonable amount of time.

Goal: I would like someone to both help me with strategy in building content/marketing/technical development for my own website, MusicAlgo.com, and general guidance in the things I should be doing to develop and thrive as an engineer. 

Challenge & Disability:  • sleep • sticking to a schedule • navigating my future and development as an engineer My disability has had positive and negative impacts. I have had to be very disciplined about creating external structure for myself in the areas of time management and organization. I have also had to find unique study strategies as a nontraditional learner in a traditional learning environment. Sometimes people can be very hard-headed and insensitive by saying things like you'll be flipping burgers your whole life if you don't follow a typical learning style. I think it has made me stronger though, and in some ways, even though the basics don't come as easily to me, the strategies I develop for myself train me to be analytical about the challenges I face. This attitude has helped me accept my disability and has made me stronger and more productive in the end. 

Preference: Someone with experience in web development, software engineering, social media, entrepreneurship, education would be great too!

Personality: I look for win-win situations, and I have fun in the process: )

Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: I'm very interested in accessibility/mobility technology. I'd like to be involved in a marketing, product management or business development role.

Goal: I'm currently in an MBA program learning more about business development and honing my soft skills. I'd like to learn more about technical skills and the state of the accessibility technology space today.

Challenge & Disability:  It's impossible for me to go to movie theaters because they aren't closed captioned. There are a few movies that have captioning via rear-window captioning system, but they are at inconvenient times or locations. It's also very difficult for me to hear on my phone. I use the speakerphone and hold it as close to my ear as possible. Lastly, waking up to a travel alarm is tough - they have small boxes that go in the pillow, but they often fall out or are unreliable. It would be nice to have wearable technology like a watch or socks that vibrate. 

Preference: I use lip reading while listening to someone, and have difficulty hearing accents. Would prefer someone who annunciates well and has a strong voice. Since it is an online program, location doesn't matter, but if there are chances to meet in person, I would love the mentor to be in NYC! Lastly, I'm specifically hoping to be matched with a mentor working with accessibility technology, or at least for a company that supports those efforts such as Google. 

Personality: I make those around me feel like they matter

Referral: Through an email from the Moses Center at NYU Stern!

Hanu Chaudhari MenteeApplicationMcMaster University, Biomedical Discovery and Commercializaiton (Health Sciences), Expected 2019?Male?Disability:  Mental Illness - Depression?Hamilton?August 3rd, 1997
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: My top 3 fields of interest within technology are biotechnology/biomedical technology, data science and machine learning, and software development. I am passionate about biomedical technology because I have studied and worked in the healthcare sector and can see the gaps in current infrastructure and treatment. I am inspired by biopharmaceuticals and devices for the amelioration of human disease and hope to use the program that I am in to continue to support my interests. Data science and machine learning fascinate me because I believe that they are pivotal components in every industry and have infinite applications. The fields are constantly evolving and I would love to learn about how someone with no experience can get started. Software Development is an exponentially growing industry that is the backbone of every successful company or organization. I realize that coding knowledge is a highly valued skill and want to be involved to begin learning coding and apply my health background to the industry.

Goal: I would like to gain some experience networking with individuals in the technology industry, connect with organizations that value someone with a health background interested in technology, and be inspired by my mentor alongside having someone to converse and soundboard ideas off of. 

Challenge & Disability:  My top 3 challenges are a lack of networks, a lack of motivation/drive, and difficulty starting. My disability has made it difficult for me to have the motivation to pursue the dozens of ideas that I get daily. It is hard for me to stay consistent and disciplined. One day I may be quite motivated and willing to begin learning and researching a new industry, while simultaneously I can go days without believing in my capabilities. My disability has made it difficult to believe in my capabilities and apply them to new projects and ideas.

Preference: Preferably in Hamilton, if not Mississauga and if not there then Toronto. I would prefer someone who has also struggled with mental illness. An individual of any age older than me would be great. The industry could be biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, or really any industry where health and technology intersect. I would like to have informal conversations about managing mental illness while also gaining networking experience.

Personality: I never give up! I am persistent and constantly reflect on what I can do better.

Referral: LinkedIn

Other: Would love to have a mix of conversations and learn about experiences while also developing tangible skills or attending events.

Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: AI, I'm interested in this aspect before philosophy and my other fields of studies used to be in cognitive science until linguistics of all courses throttled me. It's a field of study that'll change society in the future. High tech in general, that's how I got into 3D printing even though I'm an arts students.

Lisha Pottackal MenteeApplicationDisabled.?Female?Disability:  I am legally blind. ?Cherry Hill, NJ?27th May, 1985
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: My passion for technology helps me strive to make tasks easier for myself and others. I would like to streamline processes by advancing my skills in coding, creating new apps and enhance disability features in these apps and websites. I want to create features that integrate voiceover, Siri and other descriptive features. I believe there has to be some way to have descriptive audio for movies automated similar to adding a close caption track. 

Goal: I hope to network with others in the field of computer science and find more recruitment opportunities for myself in the future. In the next six month, I would like to enhance my coding skills beyond HTML and CSS. In addition I want to give feedback to companies on how make their devices more accessible. 

Challenge & Disability:  It is difficult to navigate through cities on my own. I walk around New York City and Philadelphia with a white mobility cane. I try to use google maps to help me determine how to navigate to my next destination. I still tend to get lost a lot and find myself asking people my current location and then ask direction to a nearby cross street . Eventually I get there. I struggle to read articles. I can listen to articles via voiceover when available. Otherwise I have to enlarge the print and read the text slowly and increase eye strain. Through out the day's routine, I tend to strain my eyes staring at blurry images attempting to make them appear crisper. Eventually eye strain causes severe fatigue. I have to take naps to refresh my eyes. Only a little time remains to partake in other activities.

Preference: Disability nor age is not a factor for  me.  I believe every person I get to meet broadens my perspective and adds indelible value to my life. I hope to work with a mentor who is compassionate, hard working, innovative and has at least ten years of work experience.

Personality: I am a quick learner and an effective problem solver.

Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: I am interested in virtual reality and game development, particularly in building environments. I have been working on small projects within the Unity and Unreal Engine, having taught myself how to create 3D environments and assets.

Goal: I want to learn how to better endure stress and interpersonal interactions in the work place, and if possible, learn some of the technical skills that I would need to succeed. I also would appreciate help with recruitment and networking, as I find myself at a loss for where to continue beyond sending out applications that haven't gotten anywhere, yet.

Challenge & Disability:  I'm having a difficult time finding my way in the industry, and am worried I don't have the confidence or skills to proceed, despite working hard to remedy both. When I am unwell, I lose all hope in finding a place where I can begin to have a meaningful career, and have a very difficult time seeing much of a future for myself. I took eight years to complete my degree, with normal setbacks and stresses affecting me heavily.

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: I am passionate about improving health through technology. For me, there are two main forms this takes, one through improving healthcare and products centered around improving health and the other is through more "clinical" applications such as using data to improve diagnostics, or using modeling to study proteins. I am interested in using data in both of these space to identify and understand and develop solutions that improve quality of life.

Goal: I would like to gain more technical skills and develop a side project that I can work on. Right now, I feel really behind in the coding world, so I would just like to build my skills, and increase my exposure and confidence in tackling problems. I

Challenge & Disability:  Every Wednesday I go to the out patient clinic at Dana-Farber and get treatment. I always feel like I am tired and trying to catch up with my classmates. I also feel like the extra time I spend catching up, takes away from the amount of time and energy I spend socializing, so I have not necessarily built as many meaningful relationships.

Preference: I think a mentor that is working as a computational biologist, or more generally a data scientist would be a good fit. I am interested in exploring the differences between industry and academia, so maybe someone who has experiences in both.

But I struggle with basic motor skills and have visual-spacial difficulties.?New York, NY?6th March, 1997
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: In my opinion, the tech industry as a whole is the new Wall Street. Meaning that the top jobs/opportunities is now in a completely new and exciting industry. I am extremely interested in startups/venture creations, sports technology and innovation, and social media. 1. The reason why I am intrigued with start ups is because my roommate is currently working on one himself. The creative thinking involved and the potential reward makes me very curious about working within a start up. 2. As a big sports fan in 2017, I find that just with any other industry things evolve, mostly for the better. And sports is not exception to that. I'm interested in seeing first hand how technology can better sports as a whole. And what's in involved in that whole aspect. 3. Finally, I am interested in a social media platform because I see firsthand on a college campus the overall importance of maintaining a strong presence on social media. And what really intrigues me is that this whole concept of having social media platforms online is only about 10 or so years old. And now it is extremely popular and I think it will continue to be extremely successful. So I'd be curious to learn the ideologies behind the overall success and contrary to that, mistakes that companies have made.

Goal: I'd like to build and maintain a relationship with a mentor who works in a company. I think this can really help me out moving forward. I'd be interested in learning about technical skills and current projects that this certain firm is working on. Because tech today is so large and advanced, every single company wants to come out with the new product/idea. So I'd like to the see the innovation first hand and ultimately be a part of it. Technology can help this world for the better, by making our everyday lives easier. In the next 6 months, I'd like to have a better idea as to what goes into successful company., and to understand thinking and overall process that goes into new products and innovation.

Challenge & Disability:  My biggest disadvantage due to my disability is my inability to write. My handwriting is absolutely atrocious. Meaning that in every class I need to use my laptop. It becomes a little uncomfortable for me when I'm sitting in a small writing course of about 20-25 kids and I'm the only person using a laptop. In addition, it becomes extremely uncomfortable for me when there is a exam in class, and I need to take in the university's testing center because I need to use a laptop and I need extra time. Very often, later that same day or a couple days after. I'd have a friend/classmate walk over to me and say something along the lines of "oh you missed the exam. Where were you?" And because I have a nonverbal learning disorder, my classmates assume I don't have any disabilities. So sometimes, I feel embarrassed to say that I took it in the testing center, and just lie I say wasn't feeling well. That is how my disability impacts my daily life. Three challenges I'm currently facing: 1.I am extremely unsure as to what I'd be interested in pursuing as a career path. I have so many interests and such vast subjects. So I don't know what direction I plan on heading in. 2.Another challenge that I am currently facing, as a freshman in college I'm currently trying to find my core group of friends. I'm a fairly social guy, so this is not that big of a challenge. However I want to ensure that I hang out with the right group of kids. And just from meeting new people from different places really gives you the ability to learn. 3.The final challenge I am currently facing, is that I just want to make my parents proud of me. University is extremely rigorous and expensive. And I want to my parents to feel as if they're getting their return on me. They had to sacrifice so much for me to be where I am today, which I am extremely appreciative of. But I really want them to see a return on their investment.

Preference: My ideal mentor is someone who is creative, has a good sense of humor, a social personality, and is patient. The company in which I'd receive my mentor from does not necessarily have to be a sports firm, but I'd prefer the mentor be a sports fan so I ca n have something relate on. I'd prefer someone who is the younger side, yet has power within the company. Being in New York, ideally I'd prefer someone who works here in New York, but if you guys think there is a better fit in another place, I'd be more than happy to have this certain person as my mentor.

Personality: I love life, even though I was unfortunately born with a disability. I've never let that slow me down and I always try to make the best out of every situation I'm put into. 

Referral: Email from NYU Moses Center.

Other: Thank you for this opportunity. This program seems like a wonderful opportunity to gain some real life experience and to build a relationship with a professional. I am really looking forward to hearing back.

David Rafanan MenteeApplicationNYU BS Computer Engineering May 2017?Male?Disability:  Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder?New York, New York?29th Nov, 1994
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: Growing up, technology has always been in my best interests; especially how it continually transforms throughout time. Even as I'm fighting my inner demons, technology has been one of the things which keep me going up till this day. In random order, here's what interests me most in technology:  1. ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN TECHNOLOGY:  As someone who loves creating and as someone who wants to build a startup, I believe that entrepreneurship is key to not only grow in tech, but in all aspects of life. Without entrepreneurship, there wouldn't be any Facebook, Yelp, Uber, etc. And within all of these established companies, new applications in technology are implemented and continued to be transformed. 2. HARDWARE:  One of the reasons why I'm studying Computer Engineering is for hardware. I personally find it very exciting whenever you can implement software in hardware. As a result, you can see what you've built based on the hardware given. Examples of these include micro controllers (i.e. arduino), where you can build what you want to build and see it in real life in various applications. 3. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/DATA SCIENCE:  I was going to put AR/VR as my third, though I cannot pass up how much interest I have on this topic. This field is going to be the future; what will shape our lives in the years to come. Add to that my love for creativity and hardware, the possibilities are endless when these devices and more are powered by AI. This is something I'm continuously learning upon, and hopefully implement something on my own soon. 

Goal: As someone who is really close to graduating with a bunch of interests yet no direction on what to do, I would like someone that can support me in these interests while providing direction. It especially entails in ENTREPRENEURSHIP:  Having an idea for a while that I do want to build and implement. I hope I can find someone who will guide me along that. Hopefully, that person can also guide me in NETWORKING/JOB HUNT:  In addition, I do want to get more experience on how things are done and I do believe that knowing more people in the technology field and working in established companies. This leads to me working on my TECHNICAL SKILLS:  It is debatable overall, but I do want to be much better than I was and hopefully be one of the best someday in what I do. I definitely love someone who can help me in this as well. 

Challenge & Disability:  Growing up, I've always had a feeling of seclusion from people; finding comfort in solitude. Having overprotective parents trying to shelter my life as best as they could in addition, I've had symptoms of depression and anxiety, though I was in denial of it; making believe I was as happy as I am. This was validated when I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder back in December 2016. Since then, here's my current challenges:  1. MAINTAINING MY INTEREST IN THINGS:  It does become hard to concentrate, much more have a passion, on things you're already passionate about when you're afflicted with Depression and Anxiety. Your interests are replaced with events that even you don't know what to expect but one thing is certain:  you don't want to experience them. That leads to the feeling of ending it all, leading to my next challenge which is 2. TRYING TO BECOME THE PERSON I WAS:  Mental illness in my point of view, make us believe that we are something which we are not, or change us drastically that no one would expect us to be like this, especially ourselves. This leads to us wanting to "end it all" as iterated in the above point, or as people say:  suicide. Giving up is easy, but trying not to is not. Trying to be who you once were is harder. This is something that I'm still striving for up to this day and while working on it, this is what I've learned:  3. EVERYTHING IS MUCH HARDER TO DO:  How can you survive if you can't even get out of bed? How can get things done if you can't even be remotely concentrated on what you're supposed to do? Everything from as little as taking a shower to as complex as getting various types of work done at once has the same magnitude. When realizing this and not knowing what to do, here is what I've learned:  LIFE REALLY IS BEAUTIFUL:  Even amidst all the chaos and demons in and out of my head, there is a way out in the end. Family and friends that show their support as well as others willing to fight alongside you help build the way out for you. I hope if I do get accepted, my mentor will help me find a way out as well. 

Preference: I hope my mentor is a cofounder of a startup or company who also loves technology as much, if not more, than I do and is proficient in technology skills as well. Location is not prioritized, though I do hope that he or she lives close or is in NYC. 

Personality: My mental illnesses don't define me, and I will make them not to. If I do succeed in this, then I am awesome.

Isabel Taylor MenteeApplicationSchool:  Oberlin College, Major:  Computer Science, Graduation date:  May 2019?Female?Disability:  Broadly, I have a processing disability, meaning my brain categorizes things in confusing ways. It manifests in the named disabilities I have:  dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and (mild) dyslexia. In addition to these, I have short term (and long term) memory problems, which only exacerbate the problem. ?Oberlin, Ohio?2nd December, 1997
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: I was attracted to technology because it can inform and improve our human experience. Because of that, my interests are focused in three areas:  Machine learning/ AI; So we can learn new truths. Digital humanities/ Data analysis; So we can contextualize these truths. Design; So we can convey these truths. 

Goal: I would love to grapple with my disability with an experienced mentor - and just talk about the realities of it. Many people offer compassion, but I've had a lot of trouble finding good advice. I would also love support on a technical project - I've recently been interested in sentiment analysis (and topic analysis), and would love to do some work analyzing different websites' leanings on obscure topics. Lastly, help with more mundane things (like professional development, how to write a good CV, improving my LinkedIn) would also be lovely.

Challenge & Disability:  I struggle because I am hidden. I struggle because I myself do not understand what is against me. I struggle because I miss out. I struggle because people do not understand. I struggle because friends tell me I don't really have a disability. I struggle because I have been reprimanded for existing. I struggle because I must act like I don't. How do I explain what my disability is? How do I reconcile when I mess up because of my disability/ how can I forgive myself for being as I am? How can I be professional, when my disability is against me the entire way through? 

Preference: I would prefer a mentor with a hidden disability, or a processing disability similar to mine. Work leans towards the creative side, but has a lot of coding/ technology integration. I have no preference for age, or location. 

Personality: Laughing is my favorite pastime.

Brian Do MenteeApplicationUniversity of Washington, Seattle. Bio major who plans to transfer over to bioengineering or human center design engineering. Graduate in 2018?Male?Disability:  PTSD, anxiety (from Car accident - multiple surgeries, fractured back)?Seattle, WA?12/14/1988
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: I have an interest in biomedical technology. Specifically, I want to get into 3D printed prosthetics, Tissue regeneration (minimum invasive, rapid wound healing) and mobile health apps (patient centered focused). As someone who has been in the healthcare system and a per-engineering student, I wanted to do my part to decrease costs and stress to patients and their families. I also want to find ways to lower the disparity in healthcare access. The technologies I have mentioned all have potential to attack these problems. 

Goal: I would like to network as I feel my current network so far is not geared towards my interests. In addition, I want to be able know how to navigate my way into the workforce with my disability (how to talk to employers, how to deal with situations that involved it). I also would to build up my experience in a lab environment as a lot of the research and work I have done so far is more "theoretical" than any sort of physical application. One project I want to get off the ground is using 3d Printing for medical use for underserved populations such as dentures, prosthesis or patient education (public/global health) materials. I have some sort of start through the non-profit organization Vietnam Health Clinic (based in UW) but I know there are a lot of other factors (laws on 3d printing use, cost, operating, etc). Another side project is looking at creating a patient health record system that can be used in a rural/global health setting.

Challenge & Disability:  My biggest challenge is managing my PTSD which has had a negative impact on my academics (missed class, retake class, withdrawals). It affects my memory, ability to focus and be motivated. Due to generational and cultural differences, it is also hard to talk about PTSD with my Vietnamese family. This forced me to advocate for myself and find other lines of support. For better or worse, my disability has changed my relationship with my family and in some ways my outlook in life. I would say another challenge would be not being to hard on myself. I have pretty high expectations with myself which is a double edge sword in terms of motivation. I have made strives to "mellow" this side of me, especially as I have gotten older. However, I still am working on this as when coupled with anxiety can affect me greatly. 

Preference: It would help if the mentor is based in Seattle as I am able to travel around here with ease. I think it would also help if the mentor understood PTSD and has faced its difficulties. My ideal mentor would preferably be in biomedical technology or human center design/human interaction engineering as these would be the industries that I would like to get into following school.

Personality: I am a compassionate person who is very analytical and curious of the world around me.

Technology & passion: I have a particular passion for designing and developing web and mobile applications because here in Africa there are a lot of problems that we can solve with just a single application (for example reminding a mother to take her child to the Hospital for immunization).

Challenge & Disability:  Have a very good training Create my own business The fight against discrimination Disability has greatly affected my life. The main impact is that all that I dreamed to do as a profession (reporter or military) were not anymore possible for me.

Kristen Marventano MenteeApplicationNew York University College of Arts and Science Computer Science Fall 2017?Female?Disability:  Depression with psychotic features?Staten Island, NY?May 19, 1995
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: 1) Data Science:  I went into college as a math major because of my interest in data analysis, but as my course work advanced the level of abstraction was hitting the stratosphere. One of my favorite assignments was the last project for data structures. We had to apply everything we've learned throughout the semester and optimize our first homework assignment and justify our design choices. I loved running tests and analyzing the data from them to create my report. 2) Software Engineering:  When I started college, I had never used a computer for anything more than Netflix and MS Office. I was really intimidated by the required computer science classes for my major, but I ended up doing very well in them, and by the time I was in what I thought would be my last computer science class, I was emailing the department for special permission to take a few extra computer science classes because I loved coding so much. I want my work to include a good amount of coding. 3) Education:  I've always loved teaching, and I've been a tutor and teaching assistant for my whole college career. I think I don't fully understand something until I'm able to teach someone else about it. I get a lot of joy out of seeing other people go from not understanding something, to mastery. I also find educational technology fascinating. I'm currently developing a web application to help children visualize and better understand common core subtraction methods through a cashier game.

Goal: My biggest goals are to get a full-time job before graduating in December and reach a place in treatment where I can start scaling back on the amount of time spent in treatment. For the former I have a lot of sub goals to achieve that will help me. I want to beef up my portfolio. I have a few ideas for this, like a computer science study website and a mindfulness/grounding iOS app. I want to practice for 'whiteboard coding,' and general interview preparation to make me less anxious and more confident. I also want to teach myself how to create and effectively use databases. For the latter, I plan to continue being engaged in treatment, advocating for myself, and building my support network.

Challenge & Disability:  1) Balancing my treatment with school:  I’m enrolled in an intensive outpatient day treatment program while going to school fulltime. My providers and I agree that I need the amount of treatment I’m receiving, but it is very difficult. Most people at my clinic are on medical leave, and I’m struggling between what I need to do for my health and what I need to do for my future. 2) Disclosure:  my family and a few close friends know about my illness and struggle to recover, but most of my peers do not. I’m also trying to figure out how much I need to/should disclose during the interview process/during my job search. I had to take a medical leave from school, and that shows up on my transcript. I was also unable to get an internship my junior year because of conflicts with my treatment schedule. 3) Full-time interview prep:  I’m preparing for full-time interviews. It’s difficult, but I have a plan in place that I’m trying to stick to. It’s hard to keep on top of it with school and everything else going on right now. 

Preference: My ideal mentor would be a young women in some area of software development, data science, or some other programming heavy industry. Preferably in the NYC area and with some kind of mental/psychiatric disability.

Personality: No matter what the world throws at me, I continue to to persevere and excel.

Varun Yadav MenteeApplicationUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign?Male?Disability:  Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder?Illinois?2nd Feb 1994
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: 1. Design - After reviewing several of my peers' programs and falling prey to the pitfalls of poor design, I have started placing an increasing amount of emphasis on software design and architecture. But, that is not the real reason obviously. It's much more selfish than that. I, like I mention above, live with obsessive compulsive disorder. The disorder brings with it a plethora of problems that I struggle with on a daily basis. But, it does have its positives too. One of the biggest in my opinion is my obsession with writing code as best as possible. This includes thinking about the problem thoroughly before even writing a single line of code, drawing out the algorithms I'll use and how it will work with the intended data structures, and finally writing the code itself in a well thought-out and conceived manner. This is, indeed, slow. However, I absolutely love doing it this way and am usually proud of the end result. Similarly, my obsession with writing good code makes me ask myself if there's a better or faster way to implement a particular program and I will sometimes exhaust myself trying to find the best possible implementation. Again, I'll concede that this is slow. But, I learn so much in the process and come up with excellent implementations as an end result. As technology gets more and more prevalent in society and we find ourselves surrounded by multiple devices connected to the Internet with our personal information on it, it becomes imperative that we pay attention to writing the best code we possibly can. This leads me to my next interest... 2. Security - Over seven BILLION data records have been breached since 2013 and only 8% of them account for 'secure breaches' where the stolen data was encrypted and therefore rendered useless. Millions of customer data records get stolen via hacks on large corporations such as Home Depot, Target, and JP Morgan Chase among others. While most fires can be put out simply by changing your password on relevant websites, sometimes the identity theft is severe enough to cause extensive harm. The recent Anthem hack comes to mind. Accessing private medical credentials such as names, SSNs, and health insurance numbers can be used by criminals to defraud government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Moreover, I'm severely concerned by the existence of software such as FinFisher, which can be bought on the market and be used to covertly spy on any target that the user desires to extract personal and financial information from. In the climate we live in today where massive troves of data are generated each second, I feel it's very important that we uphold that data to high standards of security. I am quite fascinated by this battle of securing our data and wish to contribute toward that end. 3. Machine learning and data mining - It is so interesting to me that there exist patterns we can find that a human mind may miss but a computer can pick up. The design, study, and implementation of models which mine data, especially via unsupervised learning, is another area which I find quite intriguing. Due to the scope for improvement in this domain and the number of challenges to overcome, I feel excited at the prospect of delving further into ML in the future.

Goal: I know I'm an excellent programmer with a brilliant knack for problem solving. My resume, however, doesn't reflect that. I don't even have one in fact, not one I can present anyway. I want to be able to reach a position via the course of this mentorship where I can present the skills I possess to the world at large. I am quite hungry to learn and appreciate any advice that comes my way. I want to know how to traverse the workplace and how I can effectively fit in a world where I'm a tiny minority. These include the aspects mentioned above such as soft skills, technical skills, recruitment, networking, and most especially projects that I can work on and someone can help guide.

Challenge & Disability:  My disabilities pervade every part of my life. It is who I am, it defines me, and I proudly say that. There are many positives with having OCD and Bipolar disorder. But, there are obviously many challenges as well. My top 3 would be:  1. Time - Obsessional slowness is a huge drawback of having OCD. Everything has to be perfect and it has to be perfect now. From brushing your teeth and tying your shoelaces to finishing your assignments and staying on top of events in daily life, OCD just makes the entire process very, very slow. I lose sight of long-term goals in order to compulsively ensure that everything is perfect in the short term. I'm 23 years old and still a junior in college. But, I'm getting better every single day and I've come a long, long way since I was first diagnosed in November 2011. Things just keep looking up. 2. Depression - This is much more serious than OCD. I suffer from Bipolar disorder too which, as the name suggests, has an up and a down period, and both are quite horrible. During the depressive phase, my world gets very gloomy. It sometimes takes me over 30 minutes just to get out of bed in the morning. This is despite me knowing that this is just Bipolar depression and it will subside in some time. But knowing about what is happening to me is not enough to make my situation better and I have to suffer through it. I fail to be me during this period. My personality, my desires, my passions, my likes, my dislikes etc. escape from me in that period and I'm left trying to fill that void. The 'me' in me vanishes. But again, this is temporary and, luckily due to the episodic nature of the disorder, it hasn't happened too often. Plus, I always come out better and stronger than I go in. 3. Realization of my potential - I'll hark back to OCD here. OCD has one massive advantage. A massive advantage over most other people, in fact. It is something so big, that I can use it to very effectively leverage my footing in the world, in my life. But it comes at the cost of the first thing I talk about above, time. What I'm trying to refer to is the realization of the biggest skill that I get from the pandora's box of OCD:  perfection, or the pursuit thereof. My biggest strength in life is that I can pick one skill that I want to excel in and can ensure, given enough time, that I become one of the best in world at performing that skill. The skill that I've chosen for myself is to code. However, this advantage comes with a caveat of its own. It needs all my time. When I say one of the best, I truly mean it. I have extraordinary talent that I want to thoroughly nurture. But, I need all my time to do that. So, how is this a problem? Well, I can't just code in life, can I? I have to take other courses, submit other assignments, fulfill other obligations (not referring to essential ones, that I always have to do) that conflict with my desire to just pursue what I'm most passionate about and want to devote all my time to. Sadly, this is a problem no one can solve. At least, not easily. This is the bittersweet pill of OCD:  I can be extremely good at one thing, but then I cannot have other things dividing my attention since I compulsively try to perfectly do everything, and its best to do just one thing perfectly, the thing that is most important in your life.

Preference: An ideal mentor for me would be someone who shares the same disabilities as me (either one). This would be the most important thing since that person would be able to very well relate to and understand my situation. I would love to hear from someone who has been there and done that with my circumstances. : ) Second most important factor would be having someone from the Computer Science industry itself.

Personality: My perseverance:  I never give up, keep on fighting hard, and I absolutely love doing it.

Referral: From my university's Disability Resources and Educational Services institute.

Other: I think this is a great initiative and I would live to thank everyone involved. It's serves as a beacon of hope and that has its weight in gold for the people in my community.

Remington Shandro MenteeApplicationDalhousie University, MSc Audiology Candidate, May 2019?male?Disability:  hearing impairment - congenital moderate to moderately-severe "cookie bite" genetic sensorineural ?Halifax, NS, Canada?January 7, 1994
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: My main areas of interest are design and product management. I know how important hearing aids and other devices are to those, like me, who require them. I'd like to do everything I can to make these devices more accessible and user-friendly for all. I don't know whether that means building assistive devices that can be used with conventional hearing aids, building tools that can help people with cognitive challenges or poor dexterity to better use their hearing aids, or completely rethinking what hearing aids are and how they are used - perhaps its a combination of all of the above.

Goal: I would like to network with people involved in the hearing technology industry and use my personal and academic experiences to develop solutions for people with hearing impairments. I have some ideas that I have attempted to various degrees. I've 3-D printed a very rough prototype of a tool to help people with poor dexterity insert and remove their hearing aids. I've also worked on installing and running a simple hearing aid device on a RaspberryPi. I also have an idea for a very practical, mirror/hearing aid case toolkit that could help new users with inserting, removing, and maintaining their own hearing aids. Beyond that, I'd also like to change the patient experiences of being fit with hearing aids, and reduce the negative stigma surrounding the devices. 

Challenge & Disability:  Thankfully, with the use of hearing aids and a little extra effort on my part, my disability is not debilitating on a day-to-day basis. However, I do have difficulties understanding others in loud, noisy, and busy environments. As well, participating in some social sports can be a challenge due to the danger of sweat damaging my hearing aids. After a long event in a challenging environment I can feel completely exhausted. As well, I live in constant fear of batteries dying at inopportune times and my devices breaking or getting lost and requiring expensive repairs or replacements.

Preference: I'd like to be paired with someone who also has a hearing impairment and is involved with tech or design industries.

Personality: I'm driven by a relentless passion for helping and educating others

Second, solitude because I prefer staying alone without having to unveil that I have some speaking difficulties. Finally, anger. Stammering people are likely to be angry.

Preference: Llike I mentioned above, I want to gain a growth oriented position in institutions where my educational, professional, and leadership abilities will be needed and developed in collaboration with mentors, to build strong international professionalism and career records and contacts. These are my expectations from the mentorship despite my disability. So said my ideal mentor is the one who can boost me and help surpass myself and overcome my disability in order to be as auccessful as those successful people around the world. My mentor should be from the United States because as from a french speaking country I also need to interact with english speaking people to improve my English. He should be at least 45 years old and a professional man in the administration domain who had been through issues and a disability that he overcame by becoming a successful man today.

Joseph Stead MenteeApplicationUnemployed. Most recent employer:  UST Global. Education:  Central Washington University, Electronics Engineering Technology with Computer Engineering specialization, June 2014. Certified completion of Microsoft Autism Program June 2015?male?Disability:  Atypical Autism Disorder?Bonney Lake, WA?1st Feb, 1992
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: Embedded Engineering seems to be my strongest suit, I believe I was at my peak of usefulness when I was heavily performing hardware testing on what would see release as the ViewPlus Columbia embosser, while contributing small updates to the firmware repository (a locally hosted Subversion, thus why I used a trick to leave the GitHub field effectively blank.) The programming languages I seem to be the best at are those that use the Function Block Diagram model, which is strongly evidenced by me developing a major component, as well as directing and performing component integration, on the EV3 code used for a team project in the Microsoft Autism Program. While it's not as glorious of a route as engineering or programming, I seem to have an intuition for systems administration and quality assurance. I've been upgrading computer hardware since 2003, and building from scratch since 2011. This has led to me troubleshooting PC issues for friends and family since around 2005, and on rare occasion help others out with Android and iOS devices as well. While Windows (3.1 through 10, most of my experience is with XP, 7, 10, and a few private alpha releases of 10TH2 and 10RS1) is the OS I typically deal with, I have some experience working with macOS (7.1 through 10.11) and Linux (mostly Debian-based but I'm starting to use Arch derivatives as well).

Goal: I believe my greatest needs would be in soft skills and recruitment, as I cannot seem to market myself effectively no matter how much help I get from vocational rehabilitation and unemployment offices. Adding to this, I did not integrate very well with the team I was in when I worked for Intel through UST Global. (However, since it was a hostile workplace due to blatant duplicity being the only thing to earn anyone commendations, that may be a foregone conclusion even if I had great soft skills.) I am tempted to ask for help networking, but I am absolutely terrible at staying in touch with people professionally. (However, a large part of it is I don't know how to do so effectively without sounding needy and whiny.) While I hope to get a job in my field that makes use of my talents and has an upbeat atmosphere (I had a job like that at ViewPlus but a budgetary layoff cut it very short), I think I will try to start a small computer OEM business if and when I exhaust unemployment benefits in July. It may not be that glorious of a business to run as building and testing PCs with release hardware is trivial, but I know I can build and help others set up PCs. It might also not be the most economically sound business idea as places like that go out of business rather fast around my area, but I'm willing to try since my family has been housing me for so long.

Challenge & Disability:  My biggest challenge is that I have trouble interviewing, and appear to be slowly getting worse at it. While I can carry an honest conversation about my strengths and weaknesses, I seem to be unable to generate any hype. I can generate goodwill and warmth, but lack the public pomposity needed to generate active interest. I've even had trouble getting to the interview stage in my field lately, as the most promising interview I've had in recent memory was all the way back in late November 2016 with a small school district. My skill set is too fragmented to generate interest from employers looking for a good employee. (I only got the job at UST Global because they wanted people to rubber-stamp known-defective drivers as "passed QA".) I can develop software and have done well in an abstract math course (to the point the only stains on my record were due to making leaps I wasn't supposed to know), but cannot for the life of me structure data at a 300-level course level. I can do data flow intuitively, however, which gives me my strength in embedded engineering. However, I tend to get completely lost in complex math (such as differential equations). I tend to describe this combination as "too much of an engineer for computer town, too much of an engineer for computer town". To be honest, recent family emergencies involving my grandmother (which include a memory care commitment) have placed me under strain I cannot seem to adequately relieve. This will hopefully ease with time, though. My disability very strongly affects my ability to socialize, where my mind only seems to have two settings for people I do not know well. Those two settings are "heartless" and "gushing". I barely function socially on "heartless", but on "gushing" I tend to rapidly and effectively shoot myself in the foot by divulging too much or wording myself into corners. This even persists on chatrooms where I have been on staff for over a year.

Preference: I believe my ideal mentor's location would be the Pacific Northwest (anywhere works, but the closer the better), preferred disability would be one on the autism spectrum or a form of ADHD (I tend to get along well naturally with people that have that "rythm" but still have firm grounding), no real preference on age (I know differences in advice tend to exist between ages but I don't know which, if any, is better), would prefer the consumer electronics or embedded devices industries, and do not know what type of experience to ask for (I'm tempted to ask for embedded programming experience, but I've been led to believe that use of that experience is very rare in the US.)

Personality: I have a knack for flowing things together, but need to take a lot of notes to prevent flowing the wrong way.

Referral: I heard about it through the University of Washington AccessSTEM mailing list. (I'm subscribed using the email address dashwarts@gmail.com )

Other: I am not sure how this mentorship will work exactly, but I think I need a very reactive level of interaction to do well. (Part of how the Microsoft Autism Program worked so well for me was that it was in-person. Online, I seem to work way better in fast environments, such as chatrooms, as people can correct me faster and there's pressure for me to not second-guess myself proofreading too much.)

Kaitlynn Norris MenteeApplicationWichita State University, Biomedical Engineering, graduating May 2018?Female?Disability:  Stargardt's Dystrophy?Wichita, KS?15th Aug 1995
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: My main interest in technology within engineering. My major at WSU is Biomedical Engineering and I think this is very interesting and can help improve the lives of others. Within engineering I think regenerative medicine is where my main interest and focus for my future career will be. I also think assistive technology is also bery interesting, along with prosthetics. 

Goal: I would really like to gain some insight on what it is like to be in the professional world, especially before I enter it. I would also like to know if I can compete for the same desirable jobs that people without disabilities want. What do I need to do to make myself more marketable and ready for a career in industry?

Challenge & Disability:  One of the biggest challenges that I have overcome and am currently facing is getting and keeping a driver's license. It was my number one goal when I came to college and I believe it is a necessity for me to have a driver's license to keep my independence. Also, going to college and taking difficult classes, keeping up with my assignments, and trying to make myself marketable for my future career can be very difficult too. Do I need to find a job/career that caters to my visual disability or can I find a job/career where I can push myself and be the best that I can be. 

Preference: I would really appreciate a mentor in the engineering field or in industry that can coach me through the process of graduating college and finding a career that I can excel in. 

Personality: I am awesome because I see challenges and overcome them. I am a problem solver and I want to help other achieve their goals and overcome problems too. The best feeling in the world was when I received my driver's license in the mail after I was told by so many people in my life that I would never be able to drive a car or be independent. 

Referral: My mother tagged my in a comment on Facebook. 

Other: This could be a great opportunity for many people.

Jessica Wusthoff MenteeApplicationQUANTCAST CORP?Woman?Disability:  Prosthetic leg, chronic back pain?Oakland, CA?23rd Dec, 1982
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: I work in Diversity & Inclusion and plan on continuing in this field. A mentor that is in a similar function is less important to me than someone who can help with my challenges.

Goal: I've really like to speak with someone to understand different ways of bringing my disability and accommodation needs into the equation. And how to deal with backlash if it occurs again.

Challenge & Disability:  At my current company there were illegal actions around my disability accommodation request and my SVP made a series of comments about my disability inevitably impacting my performance even though it hadn't during my first year at the company. So my biggest challenge is trying to not let that disproportionately impact my experience and I'm in HR so I don't have any support to talk about options. I'd also like to learn how other people have worked through similar biases I continue to face and how I may be able to go through the process better in my next company. I also advocate for under represented groups at my company and have made the least progress for disabled employees because it's my own demographic and there seems to be an assumption I'm just saying it's important because it's my demographic. So I would love help understanding how I can help the disabled community as much as I've been able to help the LGBTQ community, for example.

Preference: I'd love someone who has a disability and has worked at a few different companies so can speak to how they navigated accommodation conversations in different company cultures. A more senior person is preferred but not necessary. Would like someone in the US. No other specific asks!

Personality: I care immensely about the work I do and am dedicated to make companies better for under represented communities.

Kai Kane Aoki Izu MenteeApplicationStanford University?Male?Disability:  ADHD & mild dyslexia?San Francisco, California?09/25/1993
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: 1) VR & AR. As a graduate psychology student I’m most excited about the clinical uses of virtual and augmented reality. Two separate tools capable of transporting or altering one’s perspective reality have profound implications for the medical field. Improving from pixelated graphics, digital realties can help patients cope with a variety of disabilities, fears and lived experiences. As a cultural psychologist, I’m interested in VR specifically for the possibility to reduce racism and prejudice amongst treated patients. Previous studies have shown that when people of opposite views, races and cultures work together prejudice can be reduced (Allport, 1954). While Allport and other’s have found this contact theory effective, I find that scalability is lacking. Therefore, I believe that VR has the capability of exposing mass amounts of individuals to situations and cultures that they have yet to experience. Thus, I’m passionate about digital realities because they offer a practical and scalable option for both clinical and field studies. 2) Automated Marketing. As a past marketer for non-profit, startup, real estate and a fortune 500 company, marketing has been a passion of mine. Mixed with psychology and a performing arts background, I’ve found marketing to be an outlet for both creativity and innovation. I’m passionate about the way in which automated marketing software is enhancing and enabling companies to reach both specific and interested markets. Specifically, within my time at Intuit I found that responsive pages, direct A/B tests and intelligent emails are certainly the next phase in digital marketing. 3) The internet of things. I’m passionate about the ever-increasing connectivity of our digital and physical world. From Nest, smart refrigerators, smarter lights to intelligent kitchens, I’m passionate about the way in which companies working together to innovate and jointly bring technological progress to consumers and companies alike. It excites me to think about that ways in which interconnected technology has the potential to make life easier for people and lessen the cost of simply living. 

Goal: I would sincerely love to deepen my understanding of the world of technology. After growing up in a low-income community, I lack certain ideological principals that others have picked up from their more privileged background. During my 6 months, I would like to achieve a re-frame in the way that I think about my skills. I would like to work on strengthening my confidence through improvement of both soft and technical skills. Additionally, I would like to learn what it takes to become a full stacks marketer. From design, creation, campaign, analysis, I would ideally like to be able to do it all.

Challenge & Disability:  1) Memory. My specific ADHD/Other disability encourages me to work extra hard on encoding short-term to long-term memory. A doctor of mine, aptly described my working memory as a post-it compared to other’s who likely have an A4 sheet in size. While this has impacted my learning, I’ve developed a series of exercises and protocols to mitigate this “learning modality�. 2) ADHD. At times I strive for an unrealistic expectation of excellence. Working towards a goal that is clearly out of reach, I find that I over commit myself resulting in lower-quality work and mainly a reduction in self-care. This trouble of attempting excellence leads to chronic procrastination. While gloomy in nature, I’ve found my learning disability to be an asset in certain situations. 3) Networking. I struggle with maintaining my business relationships. While good at making them, I find my contacts fade with time and largely do not survive transitional periods. I think that it has to do with my memory and largely the fact that I do not think to contact these individuals before it becomes awkward. 

Preference: Bay Area, multi-racial, cognitive disability, marketing

Personality: Retirement planning gardener by day and banana pancake making collegiate psychologist by night.

Rosemarie Foulger MenteeApplicationMinerva Schools at KGI, Dual Major Computational Science (Data Science and Statistics), and Arts and Humanities (Philosophy, Ethics and Law), Graduate 2019?Assigned Female at Birth?Disability:  Fibromyalgia, Hyperlexia?San Francisco, California?30th June, 1995
Question1:  I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain and fatigue syndrome, when I was sixteen, but I'd had symptoms from the age of 7. Being undiagnosed for almost a decade was very hard, and was very damaging to my self esteem. Several of my teachers, doctors, and sometimes my parents, thought that I was exaggerating the pain or being attention seeking when I claimed I was too tired to hold a pen. It wasn't until I could put a name to my symptoms that life started to become good again. Since my diagnosis, I've been able to start medicinal regimes, get the support I needed at school, and the understanding I needed from the adults around me. Concurrently, I have also been diagnosed with Hyperlexia, a visual processing disorder characterised by abnormally high language decoding skills and reading speed, but with mediocre comprehension. At 9, I could read at almost 800 words per minute, at a college level, but my comprehension was appropriate to my age. Combined with other visual difficulties which made my handwriting poor, my spelling atrocious and my speech faltering, and the autism like symptoms that often accompany Hyperlexia in childhood, I was relegated to the special needs classrooms. It was a constant struggle to be understood, and to express the high level thinking happening behind language barriers. I have never let my disabilities hold me back. I worked hard to overcome the social difficulties that accompany Hyperlexia, I have studied and practiced techniques which help me to read and comprehend at a very high level, I have followed exercise regimens to keep my muscles flexible and mobile, and I have poured my energy into my education. I have spent all the days I had to spend in bed learning, researching and writing essays for my own entertainment and development, and I have taken every opportunity to grow. After finishing high school, I decided to take a gap year to recover from the stresses of examinations. I decided to attend a Folk High School in Oslo, Norway, where I lived with 175 other 18-21 year olds. As one of 12 international students, I spent the year learning Norwegian and studying art and design. Following that, I spent a year at university in the UK, my home country, before transferring to Minerva Schools at KGI. I transfered to Minerva because I wanted to follow a broader path than the one which had been laid out for me. I wanted to forge my own way, working on a variety of things. A brand new university, where I would be a member of the first graduating class, where I could help to shape the future of the institution, study a variety of subjects, and immerse myself in the Global Rotation Program (where students live together in 7 cities around the world over the four year degree), sounded like an ideal choice. Disability has made a huge impact on my life. I am stronger now than I would have been otherwise. I am an advocate for children who cannot speak up for themselves. I am working to transform education from the ground up, so that children like me don't have to fight so hard to be heard in a system that expects total conformity. My disabilities define me, because I am a much better person because of them.

Question2:  I am really invested in learning and advancing in the technology field. I want to combine my interests in data science, ethics and education to design systems and policies that could be of benefit to the world. I want to work on projects that push me to learn and develop quickly. I hope that the Next Billion mentorship program will help me to break into new pathways, forge new connections, and get to know some amazing people.

Technology & passion: I am majoring in Data Science and Statistics, and so far my studies have focused on impact evaluation through regression and matching. I'm really passionate about this area because I believe that all great programs, policies and plans come about through proper evaluation and control. There are so many things that we could improve on in the world by measuring them and adapting our actions to strengthen positive impact. I want to work on impact evaluation problems in order to improve systems of healthcare, crime prevention and education, to add insights to counter terrorism, to expand a growing and dynamic field, and to work with some amazing people. Other areas of interest for me in technology are the applications to education. I am especially interested in how we can build systems of adaptive learning that benefit students and teachers, bringing in my knowledge and experience in the field of education to my developing skills in technology. Other than that, I am more than willing to explore a whole variety of subsections of the technology field. As a member of the first graduating class at Minerva Schools at KGI, a university driven by technology and innovation, I am constantly exposed to new areas of interest. I have spent the last three weeks as a sounding board for my roommate, who is working on a really cool deep learning project, and I have loved hearing all about it, learning the concepts, researching so that I can be more helpful, and suggesting new directions they could take their work. I love to hear about and learn new things in this sphere, and I'm eager to connect with mentors in this program so that I can solidify my interests into projects and curricula with the aim of teaching myself more. 

Goal: I do not currently have solid ideas in mind for projects this summer. I am planning on taking a variety of online classes to boost my skills in computational statistics, machine learning and decision making, so I would love to work on a project that would help me to develop those areas.

Challenge & Disability:  I don't know if it's a good idea to admit this on this application form, but my biggest challenges at the moment are my Computational Science classes. I come from a social science background, specifically studying Education, and transitioning into CS has been a struggle. I never really considered studying CS before I transferred to Minerva, and I was underprepared for the complexity of the subject. However, I am working hard to overcome the gap between myself and other students, and it is swiftly closing. I am relishing in the challenge of my difficult major, and I have no regrets. I wanted to choose CS, even though I knew it was the hardest path, because I knew that this was the track I would learn the most from. I knew that I would come out the other end with a wealth of knowledge and skills I never dreamed I'd have, and I am so very much enjoying how hard I have to push myself every day. Another challenge I am facing is in my current internship with EdSurge, an edtech company based in San Francisco. I am running a program through them called EdSurge Independent, a cohort of students meeting once a week to talk about the problems facing the higher education sector as we advance into the 21st century. The cohort is going really well:  over the last semester, I have more than tripled monthly readership of our Medium Publication, which is populated by editorials written by the cohort members, more than doubled the size of the cohort, and expanded to 9 different countries. However, I am facing the challenge of working remotely with another intern. We have differing ideas for where the cohort should go next, and for the structure of sessions on a week by week basis. I am working very hard on coming together with the other intern under the goal of growing and strengthening the project, and I'm developing a variety of effective communication and interaction techniques. This challenge has been difficult, but fruitful, as we have started to work together much better, and the cohort is starting to flourish. The third challenge I am facing is balancing my academics, internship, social life and health. Like most college students, I struggle with time management, and between assignments, classes, friends, and jobs, I hardly have time left to manage anyway! However, when you add in the time it takes to deal with health concerns, and the breaks I have to take in order to avoid fatigue burnout, managing my time becomes a real struggle. I have tried a variety of measures to balance these constraints on my time, but this remains my most pressing difficulty.

Preference: I am open to anyone! However, I would love to connect with someone who is working at intersections between public policy (especially education) and data science, most specifically with program impact evaluation. I have no preferences for age, location or gender.

Personality: I am awesome because I am actively engaged in my life:  I spend time every day doing projects I am passionate about, learning difficult content in classes and online, and talking to people from walks of life polar opposite to my own.

Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: I'm interested by the product management because thanks to the technology the company manager could develop some strategies that successful lead the products. It also impoves the team communication and between the company and customers. In addition i like the artificial intelligence because thanks to the technology, we can make any kind of researches we want in a short time where the human being should take a long time. And finally technology made the world a planetary village where we are all closed. I'm talking about the social networks that favor the people connection. 

Goal: I would like to depeen my current skills in the issue of the technology. During the mentorship, i would like take advantage of the experiences of my mentor and from the other participants. I would like also share my skills during the workshops if possible. It means that i would like to develop the disability support, networking project and technical skills during this Program. I want to achieve in the 6 months a kind of technical luggage cited above that could help me to improve my skills of my leaddrship career for the benefit of the people of my comunity and other areas if possible. I want to go forward to establish a strong dynamic team around of the issue of technology.

Challenge & Disability:  I'm still jobless. After my University graduation, i looked for job but i have never found one and one of the main reasons was about my state of a person with disability. This is the situation that incited me to create my own organization under the volunteering working. So like other disabled people of the world, i'm sometimes victim of discrimination. The second challenge is about the lack of moving means. Where the other ones can easily walk, i need a taxi so i spend a lot of money in the transport. Therefore, i'm looking for a car that could alleviate my sufferings in this issue. Moreover, some people congratulate me when they realize that a people with disabilitylike me is doing such greats works, they are amazed and happy for my achievements. 

Preference: I don't have any specifical mentors choice to make, i rather need and experienced trainer who could come from any place of the world. I need somebody who could be able to vehicle easily what he/her learnt to others. I need somebody who is kind in terms of training and opened. Somebody is at the disposal of the mentees. 

Personality: What makes me awsome is my team spirit.

Taylor Moss MenteeApplicationBrown University, Neuroscience, May 2017?Male?Disability:  Major Depressive Disorder?Baltimore, Maryland?21st Sept 1994
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: Artificial intelligence is a big interest of mine. While abroad at Oxford, I studied computational neuroscience. I loved it. We used Matlab and I loved the feeling of getting the model to fit the data. After studying the brain for years now, I appreciate its complexity. Artificial intelligence is a form of applied computational neuroscience that tackles this complexity in a unique way that can benefit the population. Data analysis is another interest of mine. I love data analysis because it can be used to study anything. For example, while doing behavioral economic projects at the Harvard Kennedy School we used STATA to analyze water usage in California and bus safety in Kenya. Data analysis is also key in effectively contributing factual information in the sciences. Ultimately, the versatility of data analysis and its ability to conform to whatever interest I have is its biggest draw. My third top interest is software development. This is of interest to me because it seems to be the most practical aspect of computer science. It's the best way to turn an idea into reality. It also is incredibly fun to be successful at turning those ideas into actuality.

Goal: In the next 6 months, I would like to be much better at networking. I know it's an important skill and I would greatly appreciate any help. Most importantly, I would like to have a better idea of how to transition into the tech world because right now that seems impossible and I'm worried I'm watching the opportunity slip away.

Challenge & Disability:  My disability affects my life in a number of ways but there is one way that is particularly relevant. When I first went to college I was in the midst of a depressive episode. At the time, I had not been diagnosed. That is when I took my first CS class because I loved computer science. I always had; ever since I was a kid I would spend hours trying to figure out what cool things I could do on the computer. However, with my depression I wasn't going to class and I wasn't doing the work so I failed. I failed all my classes. When I was finally better I went back but I think I was so scared of the failure that I never took another computer science class. That is my biggest regret. Now I spend my free time trying to learn different languages but I know that I ruined my chances of getting a job from a technology company. I feel like it's too late. I got into a master's program for neuroscience at Oxford next year. Academia seems to be the path that I am going down. I have no idea how to even begin to enter the tech industry given my lack of experience. Missing those computer science courses is one of my biggest regrets. I watched as all of my friends got recruited like a normal technology student would and I was just trapped in my path. One challenge I am facing is this barrier to entry. I missed the opportunity and I am worried that it is gone forever. That is why I need a mentor in the tech industry. I feel like this is my last chance to do something that may be what I actually want to spend the rest of my life doing. Another challenge is that I can't be without stimulus for very long. Because of my mental illness, I need to always wear headphones or be doing something. Another challenge is that recently I have been dissociating. This will happen whenever I get stressed. One of my big fears is that it will happen while I am giving a speech or in an important meeting. My mental illness is always present and it always makes it that much harder to do work. It adds a lot of stressors in a variety of ways that I won't go into too much detail here. Suffice it to say it's something that I am constantly aware of. A mentor that understands this would be invaluable. 

Preference: Mental illness, someone in my interests with preference to AI, Google or Stanford because of the freedom given to the employees 

Personality: Passion.

Referral: Email newsletter from school

Other: Thank you so much for what you're doing. I really hope I get in. I feel like this could be what I need to transition out of my current concrete path.

Sendujan Rajalingam MenteeApplicationYork University?Male?Disability:  Social and General Anxiety?Brampton?22nd May 1994
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: I am interested in artificial intelligence, software development, and app development. I recently developed an interest in these areas from self-learning about the technological shift during the last century and current developments. With an aging and growing population, there is an increasing demand for efficiency to balance these changes. However, these areas are only in their early stages of development and further research will be required to create applications for everyday life. My goal is to combine technology and computer science with my lifelong interest in psychology (mental health and cognition) and life sciences. I would like to innovate applications that can be used in everyday life and help society as a whole. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and plan to continue my studies in computer science.

Goal: I hope to expand my network and understanding in the applications of technology and computer science. I also want to develop my soft skills in written and verbal communication and build my self-confidence. I am eager to discuss potential projects that I want to implement in the future.

Challenge & Disability:  One major obstacle in my life is developing my network of people who I may learn from and work together on projects. I also have a difficult time trying to find opportunities to learn and develop programming skills. I also have difficulty in verbal communication due to my social anxiety but I force myself to get past it in social situations. My disability impacted my life significantly. My school and extracurricular life were greatly affected because I had a difficult time to complete work or join groups due to anxiety. One of the driving factors for my passion in mental health is from these experiences. 

Preference: My ideal mentor would be an individual who I would like to be 10 years from now. This may include years of experience in computer science (artificial intelligence, software development, etc) and/or in the social and life sciences. This individual would ideally have extensive experience in research and entrepreneurship.

Personality: I can put myself in other's shoes and look at different perspectives.

Zachary Wiersma MenteeApplicationUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Chemistry Ph.D. Candidate, Estimated Graduation May 2018?Male?Disability:  I suffer from Tourette Syndrome. It effects social interactions and appearances and causes chronic back, neck, and joint pain.?Champaign, IL?5th Dec, 1990
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: 1) Science. I am a chemist by training, and am enthralled by the world of science. Overlap between science and technology excites me. It provides unique opportunities to transition academic inventions into the commercial world. The overlap of science and technology is broad, but I don't want to narrow it down to avoid limiting this field. I am interested in all areas at the intersection of science and technology, including biotechnology, energy, data science, machine learning, and many others. I do not have formal training in software, but would love to contribute to science and technology. 2) Education. The Internet provides amazing opportunities for everyone to learn. Individuals can take online classes, learn skills through videos, join a mentoring program, and read research articles. As Nelson Mandela said, "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." I believe technology is poised to change education and I wish to be a part of that movement. 3) Social Networking. Technology has vastly changed the way we communicate, with no foreseeable end to ever-changing communication. I am most interested in scientific communication via social networks because of my background. Several websites have tried to becoming the "Facebook for scientists," including academia.edu, researchgate.net, and others. However, these sites have not succeeded. I think scientists could greatly benefit from increased communication and collaboration within the community. They have been relatively slow to uptake technological changes, but new technologies could prompt adoption.

Goal: I am currently working on a personal entrepreneurial project separate from my graduate research at the university. I am building a website to serve as a platform for an open access journal with articles that are free to publish, read, and review. The journal will use a crowdsourced peer review system to improve article quality, and thus a large number of users is key. The website will also have additional social interaction tools such as groups, activity streams, and private messaging. To-date, I have taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS, built a prototype using Wordpress as a content management system, and am testing the prototype via previous business contacts. I would like to advance this project during this mentorship and receive feedback and mentorship on the project. This point was not addressed in the FAQ, but I am not looking to distribute equity. The following areas of knowledge and skills from a mentor are desired:  building social networks, journal publishing, scientific peer review, website design (CSS, HTML, PHP). I recognize that all these skills might not be possessed by one person. Please note that website design and building social networks are the most valuable skills mentioned. In the next 6 months I intend to start a company around this idea. I will graduate in about 1 year, so I have that time to pursue student competitions and opportunities for startups. Next Billion would greatly advance my project and career. 

Challenge & Disability:  I face many challenges as a graduate student. This statement is amplified by the many facets of my life. I will summarize some of these challenges below. 1) Graduate research. I am a 4th year Chemistry Ph.D. Candidate. My research focuses on the production of on-demand hydrogen fuel from water using simple aluminum-based plasma devices. The research is very applied and the devices have the potential as new sources of hydrogen power. It is exciting research and I devote serious effort to it. Hours in the lab are long and it takes a toll on me physically because of my aforementioned chronic pain. I love what I do, but it can be very challenging to perform research. 2) Raising a toddler. I have a young son who turns one on 4/30. He is very energetic and I love spending time with him. However, he starting walking at 9 months, and has been very difficult to contain. Weekends are very physically strenuous, again because of my chronic pain, and this can be difficult. Raising him is a challenge I would not trade for anything, but it is certainly challenging. 3) Starting a company. Since the beginning of December 2016, I have been working on a personal entrepreneurial venture separate from my graduate research. I describe it in more detail below. I have worked on it during the evenings and on weekends. It has been a thrilling experience so far and I am excited for what the future brings. This experience has been a challenge on many fronts, because I am learning new skills, stepping out of my comfort zone for customer development, and devoting a lot of energy to the project. My disability:  I recently wrote about my disability in a 2016 Science article (http: //science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6296/318). As a brief summary:  Tourette Syndrome affects my social interactions with others and my appearance. It is difficult to remain professional when I cannot maintain eye contact and I have to make noises over another's speech. What is unique about Tourette Syndrome, compared to other disabilities, is that people are aware I have it and am around even if they are not looking at me, because I am always making noise. However, I am no longer embarrassed by my disability. I find strength in it and wish to set an example for others. That being said, I am a novice in the tech entrepreneurship world and seek to learn more about cultural norms and what to expect. 

Preference: My ideal mentor is located in Chicago or the Midwest, and is familiar with the Chicago tech entrepreneurship culture. I prefer someone with a visible disability. I have no preference for age. My ideal mentor has a background in science, and preferably a Ph.D. Preferably, the mentor is passionate about open access and/or publishing. Most importantly:  this mentor should have experience in web design and building social networks.

Personality: I am an innovative leader passionate about providing universal access to research for the world.

Referral: Through the Disability Resources and Educational Services newsletter at the University of Illinois

Other: I have served as a mentor for several social programs, including those for disabilities. I served as a mentee for the first time through the National Research Mentoring Network this past fall. That program mostly focused on overcoming mental obstacles, which was disappointing to me. What most excites me about Next Billion is the opportunity to interface on a technical level with a mentor.

Zora Trocme MenteeApplicationEmily Carr University, Interaction Design (Graduation date:  May 5)?Genderqueer?Disability:  Learning Disabilities?Vancouver?August 30th 1995
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: The way people understand things like visual design, motion, product design fascinates me. These elements are evolving in tech at a fast pace, and new elements are created with the addition of new technologies. The languages a person speaks and the cultures they are apart of and their role in societies are factors that can effect the way people interact with technology. The challenge of designing for a multitude of variables excites me. This is why UX design and research interest me the most. Tech-healthcare is another strong area of interest for me. The main reason I am eager to apply UX design and research to tech-healthcare is that I believe everyone deserves access to amazing healthcare. To do so, healthcare professionals need to have access to the best tech in order to provide optimal healthcare. Issues like sound design across multiple devices and at home testing kits are just a few tech based healthcare issues that fascinate me as a UXer.

Goal: I'd love to find a workplace that challenges me as a UX designer or researcher, but is actively supportive of my learning disabilities.

Challenge & Disability:  I feel that I cannot be open about my learning disabilities at work or at school with colleagues until I know them very well. It gives me a huge set back to tell them in advance, as it often results in being awarded less opportunities, making it harder to prove myself. If I don't tell them about my learning disabilities and they see me struggling with something simple like spelling then they question my ability to do more complicated tasks, even though thats often where I exceed expectations. Another challenge that I face is even when my teachers, bosses and colleagues are aware and respectful of my LDs, I still don't receive the help I need.

Preference: My ideal mentor gives great critical feedback and works either in UX or healthcare and is located on the west coast.

Personality: I'm awesome because I am total nerd who loves to read, get political, travel and cook.

Mary Li MenteeApplicationNew York University, MCC/Game Design (2018 or 2019) with a minor in digital art and design?F?Disability:  ADHD, BPD?New York, NY?December 2, 1995
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: Technology is certainly quite broad, and quite accurately reflects the breadth of my interests. However, if I had to choose my top three, I would have to say design (product, UI/UX, graphic, CAD), VR, and games. I can go on a huge tangent about how games, VR, and CAD could merge into a whole new way we interact with the digital world, but to be honest I can't really say I have enough concrete information really say. I like to create and speculate, which is why I enjoy conceptual design and examining technology from a more philosophical point of view. I guess what really makes me excited about technology is that it presents to me so many possible outlets to let my imagination out and bring my creations to life. 

Goal: I would like to gain technical skills regarding 3D modeling for programs like Blender and Fusion 360 for design (of anything really). I'd also like to have an internship in a relevant field (game design, VR, etc.), so that I can have hands one experience. I'm really not picky about what I do, as long as I get to do something. I'd also like to form a lasting relationship with someone who I can relate and look up to, which I think is the most difficult out of my goals, but the most rewarding. 

Challenge & Disability:  I'd like to cut the preamble for this one and get straight to the point:  1. Terrible short term memory and easily distracted 2. Getting things started/done 3. Medication issues The first two are long term issues, which have spiraled into a vicious cycle of low self esteem and worsening symptoms. They make it difficult for me to lead a productive life, since I tend to fear failure, which leads to further procrastination. I used to be accused of being lazy because I had such a hard time getting anything done because I would forget or feel so anxious about criticism that I instinctively neglect them for self preservation. From early one, I learned that I'd rather be punished for not doing something rather than to be punished for doing an unsatisfactory job, because the former at least preserved my ego. It took me about two decades to realize that this was a terrible way to live, which prompted me to seek treatment. As a result, I was put on medication, which would be great if it weren't for the rollercoaster my inner machinations have become. I barely feel like a person most of the time and I despise my inability to live up to my own standards. I'm still trying my best to overcome these issues and I hope that I could find support within this mentorship program.

Preference: Someone who lives close by (NYC) and is willing to meet with me maybe once a month and works in some sort of design related field. Maybe also similar field of study

Personality: I like cats, BBQ ribs and sci-fi (google John Scalzi).

Referral: Moses Center at NYU

Other: I come into this with an open mind, so anything (helpful) is fine with me.

George Horrell MenteeApplicationStanford University, ?Male?Disability:  Crohn's Disease?Stanford, CA?N/A
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: "I am interested in the application of computer science and big data to chronic illness. As more advanced medical diagnostics become available to patients at lower cost (such as microbiome and genome sequencing), the possibility of accessible personalized medicine increases. While this might in the future have monumental academic impacts, such as researching new gene-specialized medication, right now the benefits of these advances are not reaching those who need it. I am interested in compassionate big data, where I can value the personal integrity of those who share my experiences with chronic illness. This might be finding dietary choices which work for sufferers of IBD with a common gene, or gym exercises which relieve the pain of those with rheumatoid arthritis. I spoke recently with an engineer who works at a pharmacy who deliver specialized medication, about how they could connect customer feedback on the efficacy of their medication with genome analysis to start tailoring dose based on genetic makeup. Applications such as this fascinate me, but I am also generally interested in the field of human interaction with big data - channeling this new trend towards utility for the public. My technical interests could be listed as follows:  Application of computer science to health. Biotechnology. Big data software engineering."

Goal: N/A

Challenge & Disability:  "College has proven to be a stressful environment with a chronic illness. The fast pace of the quarter system at Stanford puts a serious tax on me physically, and juggling all the commitments of college with Crohn’s has often forced my health to take a back seat. I am both lucky and unlucky that my disability is one that I can temporarily ignore - it gives me the opportunity to pour more of myself into Stanford, but I am often punished after periods of intense activity with worsening symptoms. I am trying hard to set myself up well for life after college, but it’s hard to prioritize with little advising and few people who understand my situation. Unlike more visible disabilities, it is impossible to explain to my peers and often my friends why I can’t go out with them, why I have to take constant provisions to look after my health and why I have to plan my day to ensure I don’t overstress my body. Stanford has an incredible, dynamic environment, but there is no real community for students with disabilities. There is nowhere to learn from others on how to manage such a stressful environment, how to make the most out of this amazing opportunity, while still finding time to be a functional human being with time for everything else that makes life enjoyable. My third issue is probably more unique to my situation. Travel is a continuous problem for me. I am an international student at Stanford (from Britain), and I was very lucky to be able to come here even after I was diagnosed with Crohn’s. My treatment was transferred seamlessly, but I rely on a cold chain medication that is difficult to get prescribed in Britain. I am therefore locked in California for all but occasional three-week stints home. I relied on my network of friends and family at home getting through the first year after diagnosis, and being separated from them has been difficult. "

Preference: "My ideal mentor is someone who understands how to balance life in software engineering with a chronic illness/disability. I am in the process of applying for internships, and picking up projects which interest me. I have heard both fantastic and concerning things about life in professional software development. I want to find an occupation that is stimulating and challenging, but also compatible with the demands of my condition. I would also massively appreciate someone who understands graduate recruitment at a large software engineering company. I feel like I am surrounded at Stanford by people who fall into two camps - those who invest themselves in personal projects, and make those their focus, and those who really dig into academics and get incredible grades. So far I have split my attention to the best of my abilities, but I would love some advising, from someone outside the university, on what kind of focus might be best in my situation. Finally, my ideal mentor would understand the importance of work/life balance. With a chronic condition, I have to manage my time even more ruthlessly than the rest of the student body here. I would appreciate some feedback on pacing myself with my workload/project load; my ideal mentor could teach me how they found their balance, and how I can apply that to find my own. "

Personality: I am full of warmth, often and most importantly for those who receive little.

Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: Technology has played a very powerful role in my life by providing me with tools that have increased my independence and autonomy. This is why I am so passionate about advocating for the use of high technology in this way and am fascinated by a broad range of technological realms. I’m interested in Accessibility because it combines my passion for technology with my passion for advocating for the needs of people with disabilities. I’m interested in User Experience/User Interface because these impact how people interact with technology. I want to create user experiences that make it easier for people with disabilities to use technology. I’m also very interested in emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, Augmented/Virtual Reality, and home automation, because of the incredible amounts of potential these technologies have to enhance people's lives in a positive way. I want to help shape how these technologies are used by people with disabilities.

Goal: I want to expand my blog (blog.cerebralposi.net) so that I can develop a larger community. I also want to brainstorm ideas on how to improve already existing Assistive Technology. Additionally, I would like to improve my communication skills, self-confidence, and knowledge of user experience best practices.

Challenge & Disability:  The top 3 challenges I’m currently facing are becoming financially independent, further developing my career, and improving my confidence. Disability has impacted my life in different ways at different times. My parents raised me to push the boundaries of what I can and can’t do. When I was a young child I liked playing in sports, despite always getting hurt. My parent’s kept putting me in sports like baseball and soccer and even allowed me to go to a sports-focused summer camp. I didn’t care that I wasn’t good at physical activities. When I was 15 I had a particularly traumatic experience at summer camp on a nature hike. That was the first time I understood that I have some very tangible physical limitations. That experience sparked my ongoing journey of self-discovery. I am incredibly grateful that I’m as independent as I am, but I’m not sure what all of my limitations are. I’m learning new things about myself every single day.

Preference: My ideal mentor has experience in the tech industry, from both the development to design and user experience side. They have a high-level understanding of where the industry has been and where it is going. Their area of expertise is usability, accessibility, and/or user experience. It would be great if they were located in New York City, but that isn’t an absolute necessity.

Personality: I am highly passionate, perseverant, and focused on living a positive life. #PMA

Technology & passion: 1. Effective use of Social Media - I want to know the effective strategies to do a better advocacy in such a way that people will be interested to my cause on Disability. 2. Graphic Design - The mind behind designing a logo or producing an artwork which I can use in my advocacy work for my project on the welfare of persons with disabilities. 3. Website - I want to learn on how to build a website without using code to showcase my project work on persons with disabilities.

Goal: I want to achieve on how do I mobilize people through technology means to benefit from disability support on my project work of Accessibility, Inclusive Education and Employment. Also I want to know how can I make the most of technology to be independent in life. Finally, I want to learn on how to create a network and benefit from people help and support on disability.

Challenge & Disability:  1. Inaccessible transport - Since Mauritius does not have an accessible public transport for persons with disabilities so this prevent me to secure a job and live a leisure life. 2. Dependent - Being a wheelchair user I am not independent for example whenever I have to go somewhere I have to rely on my parents and to many other tasks. 3. Health issue - My disability complexity causes me to suffer from recurrent UTIs and most of the antibiotics through oral means have turned resistant. Sensitive ones are those through intravenous and for this I have to admit to hospital for treatment.

Technology & passion: Top 3 fields of interest:  • Design • Software development • Network security I'm especially interested in software development. After college, my dream career is to develop software for students with learning disabilities. School can be significantly more challenging for students with learning disabilities. With the right software at their fingertips, students with learning disabilities will be more likely to succeed than if they didn't have this software. 

Goal: Over the next six months, I hope to network with many individuals, learn new programming languages including C++, C, Ruby, and JavaScript. I’d also like to build my Java and Python experience, find out about various technology fields and job opportunities associated with them. I’d also like to learn from others with learning disabilities in the tech field (e.g., what they do to be successful, strategies they use to make certain content easier to understand). 

Challenge & Disability:  ? In school, my learning challenges make things more difficult because it takes me a longer time to process the information, as well as the fact that I don’t handwrite anything. All of my homework, tests, and other school work is completed using either my MacBook Pro or iPad and stylus. ? Because homework and study take me a longer time than other individuals, I am not able to be as social as most of the kids my age. This is difficult for me as I do like to socialize. My friends often wonder why I am not able to spend time with them. It’s somewhat difficult for them to understand how much longer schoolwork takes for me because of my learning disabilities. ? Another challenge that I am facing is finding a summer job that would give me more experience with programming languages. I feel that my disability prevents me from being able to spend an adequate amount of time looking for jobs. 

Preference: My ideal mentor lives in the Twin Cities, preferably has some sort of learning disability, is in their mid to late 20s, and has experience using multiple programming languages. 

Personality: Despite the many learning challenges I have faced throughout my educational journey, I persevered and ended up getting into Macalester College, and developed an incredible interest in computer science.

Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: Technology ties into my passion because technology provides opportunities which empower disadvantaged individuals in society such as minorities or individuals with disabilities such as myself. In other industries, such as banking or film, there is more of a barrier to entry specific to disadvantaged individuals by precluding those without the proper credentials such as a formal education or connections. Though it has its own share of diversity problems, the tech industry is nonetheless one of the few industries where there is a strong and active movement in attempting to include people from all backgrounds. By its nature, technology seeks to recruit the best and brightest, regardless of race, gender, and disabilities. I am passionate about tech because I believe in its potential to unify people from all backgrounds with the shared focus of building things that better the community. Within technology, my strongest interest is undoubtedly coding. There’s an ineffable joy to creating something out of nothing and building it while optimizing for form and function. Though I am an engineer at heart, the product in its entirety remains a strong interest for me. I code because I want to be involved in the hands-on process of building something that provides some value to end-users. Beyond the actual engineering, however, there is a myriad of questions that must be considered when formulating product development, including what specific problem does it seek to address or how should this product scale over the long term. Through my previous software engineering internship at Ticketmaster, I realized that I enjoy building products that everyday people such as you or me can benefit from. Ideally, I want to work on a back-end, full-stack, or mobile development team responsible for building a consumer-facing platform that leverages the sharing economy or crowd-sourcing to provide value for the end-users. An example might be Uber which allows peer-to-peer ride-sourcing transactions or TripAdvisor which generates content, in the form of reviews, through crowd-sourcing.

Goal: N/A

Challenge & Disability:  One of my current challenges is becoming proficient at the technical interview process for software engineers. To a degree, my disability compromises my performance on these technical interviews, specifically by fluctuating my ability to linearly process information and articulate my thought processes. For the most part, this fluctuation in my mental competency is minor compared to my relative ability to perform which is why I’ve been able to not only keep up to but also outperform my peers both academically and professionally. However, this issue manifests during technical interviews largely due to the time constraint, which necessitates condensing the evaluation of a candidate in a few short hours, during which any fluctuation of mental competency is apparent and detrimental to my evaluation. Another challenge is the continuous effort not to let my disability affect my interactions with other people. Without conscious effort in controlling and managing my symptoms, I will likely express myself in ways that confuse the people I interact with, whether its by saying nonsensical words that result from my non-linearized thinking or exhibiting body language which contrasts with that of the person I interact with. Furthermore, I always found the nuances and norms of expected social behavior to be confusing and there are times where I might say things or act in ways that deviate from the norm. On more than one occasion, my inability to manage myself socially has damaged some of my personal relationships, whether they be acquaintances, recruiters, or even family members. In terms of everyday life, an invisible disability like mine manifests itself in the most subtle and insidious ways. It’s not just everyday necessities like reading or interacting with others that prove to be difficult. Even running errands that require thought, such as purchasing groceries or filing my tax returns, can be downright mentally taxing.

Preference: "My ideal mentor is someone who has either the same professional outlook as me or has been on the career path that I envision will be similar to my own. This entails starting out as a junior developer and working towards becoming a senior developer, then transitioning to a more managerial role such as technical lead where managing people becomes part of the job expectation. Ideally, my mentor also has some product management experience or has strong interest in the operations and processes involved with developing the product. Moreover, I want my mentor to understand that I am someone who is consistently eager to learn and aspires to become a better version of myself with each passing day. As such, I hope to be matched with a mentor who challenges me to think differently, pushes me out of my comfort zone and constructively criticizes me if necessary. While I would appreciate any opportunities my mentor could send my way, I’m ultimately looking for a mentor who could provide me with guidance and wants to help individuals with disabilities like myself succeed in order to break barriers around disabilities and prove that individuals with disabilities can also be high-functioning, high-contributing members of society. Through the mentorship program, I want to develop a better sense of the career path I am about to embark upon and make any modifications, whether short-term or long-term, to that path if necessary. I want to learn the actions I should undertake during my initial years in the software industry that will help me perform to the best of my abilities in addition to pivoting me towards my long term objectives. Additionally, I want to improve my understanding of everything that the tech industry encompasses. Through conversations, I could pick my mentor’s brain and learn his or her perspective about recent tech announcements, how a specific company’s products align with the company’s mission or strategy, and what to expect in the future. Lastly, I’m sure that professional success, to a degree, arises from the thoughts, habits, and actions that makes a person who he or she is. I hope that I could emulate these qualities and behavior that my mentor exhibits which may prove to be useful in life. "

Personality: I became the change I wanted to see in this world by helping orchestrate my school’s “Behind the Mask" series, a month-long series of events which facilitated the needed open-discussion of mental health on campus in addition to promoting the use of on-campus mental health resources to the student body.

Question1:  I am a disabled person who has most typically worked as a social worker. However, my career was interrupted several years ago by a sudden diagnoses of renal disease which required regular dialysis treatment. Because my treatments required so much of my time, I was unable to work for most of that time. Most recently, I have received a kidney transplant and this as been a boon for me. I now have the freedom to work and be independent, but I am not sure social work is practical for me any longer. The combination of high stress and low pay in social work will just not help me to achieve my life goals. So, my intention is to study web development/design with hopes that I will soon be working in the Tech industry. I have always been a geek and kept up with the latest tech/gadgets. I believe this career path to be the best way to accommodate my disability. As far as my experience of disability, it at times has been difficult. However, it has gifted me with gratitude, resilience, and tenacity. For sure there have been times when I wished away the realities of discrimination and prejudice, but all in all I have learned to roll with the typical ebb and flow of life. 

Question2:  I would like to be working for a tech company in Silicon Valley or operating my own web development business from home.

Technology & passion: My first two interests are related in that I am passionate about them for the same reason. They are programming and hardware. I delight in these because I love to build things. To be able to start with basic parts(whether code or components), and build something that is complex and elegant, this is joy for me. Lastly, I am passionate about design. I have always been artistic and appreciated aesthetics. Bringing these things together into one career would be a dream come true.

Goal: 1. Assisting in my coding instruction. I am attempting to learn full stack web development online. 2.Helping me to navigate the particulars of job search within the tech industry. 3. Portfolio creation.

Challenge & Disability:  1. I have a car that is somewhat unreliable. 2. Learning work/life balance. 3. My present unemployment leaves me with not much disposable income for necessities I may need in my educational/employment pursuits.

Preference: I am looking for someone who has a lot of experience working tech. Someone who is versed in programming languages and has been successful in obtaining employment.

Personality: I have the ability to remain open and excited about life and all of its potential.

Loune Calixte MenteeApplicationHealthi Founder & CEO?Female?Disability:  Multiple Sclerosis, chronic pain, ADD?New York, NY?N/A
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: Technology may address some of the widespread failures in care coordination, which can have devastating consequences for patients. My top 3 interests are around automating healthcare processes with tech, giving patients more access to their health records, and given patients more access to their care providers. These 3 interests all share the common goal of giving people with chronic conditions more control over their care and as a result their life.

Goal: Technology may address some of the widespread failures in care coordination, which can have devastating consequences for patients. My top 3 interests are around automating healthcare processes with tech, giving patients more access to their health records, and given patients more access to their care providers. These 3 interests all share the common goal of giving people with chronic conditions more control over their care and as a result their life.

Challenge & Disability:  Diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis over 10 years ago, I was spared the burden of my care due to my family’s ongoing support. In Feb 2016, I suffered a relapse and my health declined. The burden of caring for me became too much for my family, and I worried about them to lose their jobs, as I had. Handling "simple tasks" such as making calls, appointments, handling medical paperwork, etc., became arduous when I took on these tasks. So my number 1 challenge is figuring out how to achieve my aspirations in spite of MS. Second is always finding the balance between fighting through and listening to my body, and third is trying to prepare for different future possibilities simultaneously.

Preference: Most important for me is getting access to the business development opportunities The Next Billion would allow. Having a great strategy and track record for helping clients will allow Healthi to grow, build partnerships and raise capital. I'm also excited to be learn from what other mentees are working on and the different approaches each one is following.

Personality: I've been told my energy and stubbornness in getting through or around any barrier can be very infectious.

Referral: Facebook

Other: "Location:  NYC Focus:  Business development Other:  It would be great to be paired with someone who understands the advantage to my having MS"

Julia Romare MenteeApplicationComputer Science and Economics double major, Macalester College, Dec 2018?Female?Disability:  Stammer?St.Paul, Minnesota?N/A
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: "Going into college, I did not intend to study Computer Science. Thus, technology allows me to experience how it is to discover and be passionate about a new area. It assists me in broadening my horizons and to approach problems from both a structured and analytical perspective as well as giving room to be creative when looking at real-life issues. Software engineering, is probably most closely related to my current courses. I want to learn more about cybersecurity and data science, but as of now my experience in these areas is limited. "

Goal: N/A

Challenge & Disability:  "Growing up in Sweden and moving to Norway for boarding school, I have been accustomed to a Scandinavian way. Pursuing my Bachelor in the US and having to culturally adjust to this environment remains to be an experience that will impact how I think about the world, myself and my interaction with people both now and in the future. Macalester is an academically rigorously environment which challenges me, but nevertheless makes me develop in numerous ways on a consistent basement. Communication is such an important skill in our lives. Subsequently, my stutter has impacted my everyday life both for the better and the worse. Until I joined a speech therapy program called the McGuire program, I used to dread speaking situations. However, receiving the support and the tools has made me look at my speech as yet another challenge that I am looking to overcome."

Preference: My ideal mentor is someone I can openly discuss academic and professional issues with. S/he has faced and been able to overcome challenges. S/he is communicative, gives constructive feedback and is able to convey his/her ideas to a group. These are all things I want to improve or learn from the mentorship program.

Ye Joo Oh MenteeApplicationCalvin College?Female?Disability:  Motor disability, autism, schizophrenia, tics?Grand Rapids?8th Sep. 1994
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: My top 3 fields of interests are artificial technology, software development, and bioinformatics. I would like to develop an artificial intelligence that would help run the world a little better and make lives more convenient. I like building software, so I am also interested in being in software development. I am also interested in bioinformatics because I have started as a biology major and switched majors to Computer Science. I would like to combine those two interests together and work in industry related to the two fields. 

Goal: I would like to learn soft skills, help with recruitment, and encouragement with personal development. As an autistic, I have little to no soft skills. As a result, I come off as too blunt and people go with negative impressions of me. I would like to learn soft skills from a mentor who has been in the field before me. I would also like help with recruitment, because being recruited is hard. I would like help with developing my resume and being a more helpful member of the society. I would also want someone to encourage me in personal developments such as taking on personal projects and learning new skill sets. I would like to learn from my mentor and get encouragement for my progress. In six months, I would like to complete my research and finish my school. I would like to go to industry after graduation and then go to graduate school. In order to do that, I need to finish school and learn necessary skills for the industry.

Challenge & Disability:  The top 3 challenges I am facing are the general workload, balancing responsibilities and my disability impacting my life. My school has an incredibly vigorous computer science program, so the workload is not light. As a result, I have to monitor my workload and see how to manage time. I also have to manage time with other responsibilities such as finding internships and dealing friends and family members who has emotional disabilities. Although I am not directly responsible, I have to try to be a emotional pillar which takes some challenge. My disability also gets in the way sometimes because I have full body tics which disturb me from going to classes. I also sometimes cannot walk so my disability gets in the way of being productive and taking care of responsibilities given to me. 

Preference: I would like a mentor near me, but I can skype with someone far away. I would prefer mentor of any age and disability. I would like my mentor to be in either industry or academia, and have experience with biology and computer science, and being a disabled person in the field of Computer Science.

Personality: I never give up until I understand or find the answer.

May Li MenteeApplicationVassar College, Computer Science & Cognitive Science Double Major, 2020, Intern (field work) at Mental Health America, Horizons School of Technology (coding bootcamp)?Female?Disability:  Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Eating Disorder?Poughkeepsie, NY?12/10/1996
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: Cybertherapy, software development, and virtual reality. Although I am new to the tech world, I love the limitless possibilities and creativity associated with developing tech solutions to address mental health. Currently, everything I am learning in my coding bootcamp and at college is focused on mental health solutions, and this summer I will be developing software for cybertherapy purposes. In the future, as I develop my skills and experience in tech and dive deeper into the tech world, I hope to explore and work in the virtual reality world to help provide VR solutions to the mental health industry.

Goal: I would like to develop my startup idea, which is to develop free accessible mental health care to college students and high school students through gameified online and app-based resources. While I am building an MVP this summer at my code bootcamp, I would like help building a business model, organizing goals and dreams, accessing CS/mental health networking/social communities, and other soft skills like finding a tech internship. I feel like I deeply lack a tech/entrepreneurial community/support network, and I seek a mentor to guide me this network or to help me find networks in my area. I am also seeking to transfer from Vassar College to a more tech/entrepreneurial academic institution.

Challenge & Disability:  Warring with your own mind can force you to shift your priorities and can often set you back from your goals and dreams. My anxiety and panic attacks can often occupy my focus and bring in internal fears that can be crippling and hinder me from being able to tackle my goals. My top 3 challenges include lack of exposure to the business, wisdom, and communities of starting a tech startup, lack of tech entrepreneur role models, and lack of psychological support towards entrepreneurship as I wrestle with mental illness since it is very difficult for me to find people my age in college (or even professors) who support starting a company or have experience in the field.

Preference: I would really love to be matched up with someone involved in entrepreneurship on any sort of level at all or someone who understands how to network and access tech communities or has experience at a tech startup 

Personality: "This above all, to refuse to be a victim - unless I can do that, I can do nothing" - Margaret Atwood

Referral: I met a new friend and a current NextBillion mentor at YCombinator's Female Founders conference who referred me to this program.

Other: At Vassar, the computer science department is very underdeveloped and young, and it is very difficult for me to find a mentor through professors or upperclassmen. When I discuss my dream of starting a charitable startup for mental health tech, I am often met with skepticism rather than support, and even after meeting with each professor about how to go about building this dream, I am unable to find anyone who has the experience nor time to help me. I am truly aching to meet a mentor who can be a role model, voice of guidance, and source of strength as I face this journey to (hopefully) help solve the growing problem of mental health through tech.

Hesham Abdalla MenteeApplicationCoding Dojo Bootcamp and Hack Reactor bootcamp, 2015 and 2016?male?Disability:  ADHD, Major Depressive Disorder, Sensory processing and sleep disorders?Silicon Valley, CA?11/01/1992
Question1:  nil

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: I am interested in becoming a front-end engineer, full-stack engineer, and would love to work in a large company but am also open to startups. I have a background in IT but when I moved to the US I discovered computer programming through free online tools like Codeacademy and that sparked my passion that I could not only fix and build computers but program how they run.

Goal: I'd like guidance on how to find a job now that I've completed my software engineering coursework. I don't have a big network here since I just moved to the US 3 years ago and haven't had much luck getting an interview because I'm ineligible for internships as I'm not a college student and ineligible for most jobs in Silicon Valley because I don't have much software engineering experience. It's discouraging because I don't even get selected for interviews to prove my capability.

Challenge & Disability:  My ADHD has made it really difficult to focus on tasks, especially concepts that are totally new to me. ADHD also messes with my impulse control so it affects my ability to plan long-term. Also, my depression makes it hard to keep the passion alive which is necessary when starting a new career. My sleep disorders make me physically exhausted.

Preference: I would greatly benefit from a mentor who is a software engineer or tech recruiter, especially one passionate about diversity beyond just racial or gender diversity. Although I live in Silicon Valley I am open to relocating anywhere. 

Personality: I taught myself English by listening to music and practicing the song lyrics.

Referral: Friends

Other: I hope that you will consider me even though I'm not a current college student. I'm still a student/new grad and I find that all these amazing programs that require people to be students are not being inclusive to nontraditional candidates like me. It's especially tough for those of us who worked really hard to get started and are largely. self-taught who didn't have the means to go to college.

Vince Wong MentorApplication?I am currently in a period of transition. My company Mastercard has sponsored me to pursue my 1-Year MBA at Cornell Tech, Cornell University’s NYC-based graduate school designed for builders, creatives and entrepreneurs striving to lead in the digital economy. Prior to the program, I worked as a payments innovation consultant; I will return to Mastercard in June to a role that merges digital product development, business development, and financial inclusion (the exact title is being confirmed). I am also co-founder of a new startup that enables product teams to capture, curate and communicate qualitative insights from user research to create inspired products and align stakeholders. Collectively, I have 5 years of professional experience in the technology sector.?Male?I have been close to disability for the vast majority of my life. My younger brother was diagnosed with autism at age 3; I was 5 at the time. Ever since, he has helped me view the world with a more empathetic lens and continues to teach me new lessons in inclusion and perseverance daily. ?New York, NY?4th Sept, 1990
Question1:  As co-founder of my startup, I have worn many hats despite having only one head. In our first months, I served in a Product Lead role to define, articulate, and validate the product narrative, speak with our customer archetypes, and prioritize our feature development with our technology lead. At the same time, I collaborated with our head designer to establish our product’s visual and lexical identity. Today, my role centers on Strategy and Operations, where I focus on identifying business opportunities, building key relationships, and setting the tone for our company culture. However, I also act as an informal advisor to my other teammates who often see my role as consensus-builder or ‘diplomat’. I’m fortunate to be working on a team of 5 talented practitioners from diverse and complementary walks of life. We’re working on an enterprise SaaS product that embodies human-first design principles. 

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: My top 3 fields of expertise are 1) Design research, 2) the informal economy, 3) Digital financial inclusion. Through my startup I have accumulated a deep knowledge base around the drivers that influence design and user research decisions. At Mastercard, I had the opportunity to learn about the many hurdles as well digital solutions addressing the pain points of underbanked consumers in low-resource communities and disenfranchised populations confronted by opaque systems. Broadly speaking, I want to help my future mentee successfully navigate ambiguity. Success in technology is defined by identifying opportunities and executing on them better than the status quo – often, there is no playbook for what this looks like because it’s never been done before. I want to coach my mentee to be creative, resourceful, and ambitious – in other words, entrepreneurial. I also want to challenge my mentee to think critically about their goals, clearly articulate their vision, and attack the best-fitting opportunities.

Goal: nil

Challenge & Disability:  My ideal mentee is willing to work hard and learn. I’m a firm believer in a positive, open-minded attitude. Personally, I wish to have a tangible impact on an aspiring entrepreneur and develop a lifelong friend. As much as I’ll be mentoring, I also expect that my mentee will help me frame the world in a more nuanced and powerful way, just as my brother has. 

Question6:  nil

Personality: I’m an eternal optimist and firmly believe in the power of empathy. 

Referral: I first heard about NextBillion.org through my professional network. I’ve since had the immense joy of following and cheering on the success of my girlfriend Sandy’s mentor relationship with Celina. 

Other: My excitement has only strengthened since my first application – NextBillion.org is truly a landmark achievement for professionals with disabilities around the world. With my application, I would be thrilled and honored to join the second cohort in mentoring the ‘Next Billion’.

Sandy Woodruff MentorApplication?Product Designer, Rent the Runway?Female?I’ve been learning how to live with and manage my Generalized Anxiety disorder for over 12 years. After my remission from a diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and several bouts of Depression in my teenage years, I learned that nothing is permanent and with treatment and practice, anyone can shine light on a dark experience. I’ve become personally aware of the unique struggle invisible illnesses cause; they are more subject to judgement, shame, and a “just-get-over-it� attitude that sorely needs to change. ?New York, NY?N/A
Question1:  "As a user experience designer, I believe in the power of putting people at the forefront of technology. Fancy new tech itself is not enough to incite change. It has to be usable, accessible, built with care and purpose, and tailored to people’s needs. That said, harnessing the power of new devices and concepts where appropriate can make a huge impact. For example, when it was first released, I created a Google Glass app to help people calm down during a panic attack. The medium was perfect for the project, as it was centrally located in their field of vision and a quick easy distraction from their surroundings. This could be further expanded upon through virtual reality. The 3 fields that are most interesting to me within technology are 1) Augmented & Virtual Reality 2) Pervasive Computing and 3) Biotech/Health Tech."

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: "The realization that you are different from other people and therefore need to work harder or push yourself further in certain areas can be a tough one. I had to work to slowly learn how to feel comfortable in my own skin again. I learned how important it is to have a safe space to grow, learn, and fail without judgement, and how to ask and accept help from others. Three skills I’d love to help my mentee develop are:  resilience, scrappiness, and empathy. If the key to a successful product/idea/startup/anything is to fail fast and fail often, resilience is what lets you do that without becoming discouraged. Resilience is recognizing that failure is a learning experience to be treasured and continuing to put yourself out of your comfort zone. One of the core values at Rent the Runway (where I am currently a Product Designer) is, “Scrappiness is a virtue.� Circumstances will rarely be perfect- instead of waiting for the ideal resources or ideal situation, build whatever you can to get the job done. Finally, empathy is one of the best qualities to have in the field of tech, but also perhaps the rarest. Connecting with people and understanding their needs is a core part of my job as a UX designer, but has also helped me in so many other areas of my personal and professional lives. "

Goal: nil

Challenge & Disability:  My ideal mentee asks plenty of questions, is fully engaged, and is motivated and determined to own their growth throughout the program. One of my favorite things about being a mentor is that I am constantly humbled and enriched by students’ unique perspectives. I hope to continue to learn and grow as much from my mentees as they do from their mentor.

Question6:  nil

Personality: I’m an optimistic but grounded creative whose support inspires others to be their best selves.

Referral: My boyfriend recommended I apply along with him, as we are both excited about making a difference for individuals with disabilities.

Other: Empowering fellow females in tech has been a long term goal of mine, so I’d prefer a female mentee if possible. Also, it would be wonderful if I could match up with someone interested in the design side of tech. NextBillion’s mission resonates deeply with me, and I’d be honored to take part in this historic opportunity. Thanks for your consideration.

Saqib Shaikh MentorApplication?Software Engineer, Microsoft?Male?Yes?London, UK?N/A
Question1:  "Using technology to improve peoples' lives has been my passion since I was in middle school. I have first hand experience of this being blind - and relying on assistive technology such as screen readers, OCR, braille translators, etc, to be productive. As I began learning programming, I was drawn to the ability to have an idea for solving a problem, and craft the solution on the blank canvas of my text editor. The top three areas of technology which interest me are accessibility/universal-design, artificial intelligence, and software engineering."

Question2:  nil

Technology & passion: Being blind, there have been many challenges that I have had to overcome (shshshsh, we don't talk about them) but there have also been a lot of solutions. I think it's important for an individual with a disability to foster that mindset of finding solutions and not giving up, rather than complaining about the system; I would like to advise a mentee in how to apply this principal in daily situations; and generally gaining confidence.

Goal: nil

Challenge & Disability:  "I feel I could best guide a blind mentee; even more so in the tech sector. I feel that teaching is the best way to learn, and also look forward to making connections with not only my mentee, but also other mentors."

Question6:  nil

Personality: I'm blind, as mentioned above, but graduated magna cum laude, did a second degree, found my way to Microsoft, spoke at 13 conferences around the world, have had Bill Gates single out a paper I wrote as a must-read, have stood on stage with Satya Nadella, and haven't yet forgotten my wedding anniversary.
